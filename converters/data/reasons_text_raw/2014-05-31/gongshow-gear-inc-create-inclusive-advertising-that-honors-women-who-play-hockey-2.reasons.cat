Anywhere on the Internet and the media are sexist advertising, brutal pornography / BDSM, sexist devaluation of women generally. Girls and women should have a good education, martial arts, they should be economically independent of men, they should get good jobs, they should be confident and proud of their bodies, they must stay for their sexuality and not what men understand about that They have the same rights as men and that must to be read in a women's magazine too. No girl or woman must be sexually subjugate or have sexual contact and sexual practices with men they do not want. No girl or woman has to marry, they can, if they support each other, raise their children economically independent of men. No girl, no woman must starve or make cosmetic surgery to be beautiful for men!
