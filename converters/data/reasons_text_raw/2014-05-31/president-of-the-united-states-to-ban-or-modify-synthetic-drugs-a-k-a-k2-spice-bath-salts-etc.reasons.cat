(On the street, it\u2019s also sometimes called \u201cbath powder,\u201d \u201cherbal incense,\u201d or \u201cplant food.\u201d). What makes the term \u201cbath salts\u201d more confusing, though, is that name is used for a surprisingly large number of different chemical combinations. But the drug also apparently causes paranoid delusions and/or hallucinations. Experts are saying it\u2019s psychoactive, rather than hallucinogenic like acid, but the end result appears to be similar: delusional beliefs acted upon in violent ways.\r\n\r\nBenzodiazepines\r\n\r\nThis drug is psychoactive in nature and is used to treat problems of depression mostly. The action of this drug becomes dangerous when it is used in excess. The exact action of the drug on the nervous system is known with certainty and the specialists assert that it can cause many side effects. For example, slurred speech, drowsiness and severe depression and dependency.\r\n\r\nCrystal Meth\r\n\r\nThis is yet another drug which acts as a stimulant and was indeed a great invention in the field psycho pharmacology. It also acts in suppressing one\u2019s appetite. The action and the effects of this drug become dangerous to one\u2019s health when it is used for recreational purposes. The common effects are dizziness, visual impairment, ADHD and restlessness.\r\n\r\nKetamine\r\n\r\nThis drug is a very powerful drug that can cause hallucinations and even paranoia. It has a number of effects on the human body including anesthesia, visual and auditory hallucinations and blood pressure problems. It has been reported for a number of recreational uses and in addiction.\r\n\r\nStreet Methadone\r\n\r\nThis drug has been reported as a form of an opiate drug. Its acts as an agonist in the nervous system and it also effects heavily on the neurotransmitters which are released in the human brain. The overdose of this drug can cause pneumonia, Hepatitis, and even a number of psychological disorders. The respiratory depressions and actions it causes can even cause death.\r\n\r\nCocaine\r\n\r\nThis drug is indeed a very dangerous drug which is known all around the world as the slow killer. This drug influences a number of neurotransmitters at the same time and is extremely dangerous to the nervous functioning of the brain. It is has been banned in many countries due to the number of deaths it has caused.\r\n\r\nOpiates\r\n\r\nStreet names include Codeine, China White, Ddarvon, Darvocet, Demerol, dilaudid, heroin, methadone, Morphine, Percocet, Percodan, Talwin, and Vicodin. According to the United States Library of Medicine, many prescription drugs are characterized as opiates. Morphine is an opiate often legally prescribed to alleviate chronic pain; however, due to its addictive nature, it is administered in hospital settings. Other legally prescribed opiates include codeine, methadone and Oxycontin. One of the most common illegal opiates is heroin, a more concentrated form of morphine. The Partnership for a Drug-Free America reports that heroin is so addictive that withdrawal symptoms can appear within hours of not using.!\r\n\r\nHeroin\r\n\r\nIt is a derivative of opium and is the most dangerous drug responsible of thousands of deaths every year. The tolerance to this drug develops very fast and so the body demands more and more intake of this drug. The fatal side effects include shortness of breath, seizures, disorientation, abnormal behavior, cycles of knock outs and even the whole brain stops functioning at times leading to sudden death.\r\n\r\nLSD\r\n\r\nLSD produces unpredictable psychological effects, with \"trips\" lasting about 12 hours. With large enough doses, users experience delusions and hallucinations. Physical effects include increased body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure; sleeplessness; and loss of appetite.\r\n\r\nThe Devil\u2019s Breath\r\n\r\nThis drug has the power to eliminate free will and wipe out memory and is being dealt with regularly on the streets of Colombia. Scopolamine, or \u2018The Devil\u2019s Breath,\u2019 comes from a tree common to South America. Since scopolamine is odorless and tasteless, it can be blown in the face of a passerby on the street and, within minutes, that person is under the drug\u2019s effect. Leaving you hopeless with no free will, making you obey every order you are given.
