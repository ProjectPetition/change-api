Under the old system, I was less than a block away from the old Hospital Bus that would take me downtown or to Main Street to connect with other buses for other areas of the city.  Along with that, the elimination of the #1's trip down Fallsview Blvd. eliminates access to the Stanley Ave & Fallsview Blvd area - again, cutting me off of an easy access for transportation to jobs in that area.  I would have to use the WEGO bus, which once again, for me, involves a walk to catch the 104 bus on Victoria Ave.\r\n\r\nUnder the new system, if I want to get anywhere other than the Target Plaza or downtown with the 108 bus, I have to walk 8 blocks from my house up Jepson St. to Victoria Avenue or, over to Morrison St & Homewood Ave to catch the 102  to Main St. to make a connection for Niagara Square or, other parts of the city. Now, if I want to go out - whether it is shopping, school or, a job interview, I have to plan my timings and usually, end up having to leave extra early not only to catch the bus, but to take into account a close to 10 minute walk to get to the closest bus stop,  to be at my destination on time. \r\n\r\nAs it stands, in my quest for work, I have had to pass over several jobs I was qualified for because I could NOT access the location with Niagara Transit. When  I was attending Westlane School recently, I would walk up Jepson to Victoria, catch the #3 bus up Lundy's Lane and be at school within 20 minutes.  Under the new system, I would take the very crowded 104 bus to Main St and wait 15-20 minutes for the WEGO bus and end up being late for school. As an aside I have yet to get a seat on the 104 bus - it is the only one going up Victoria Ave and since it starts at the bus terminal, is usually full of tourists going to various areas along Clifton Hill or Fallsview Boulevard.  What was a 20 minute ride turned into 45 minutes each way, forcing me to leave my house 30 minutes early in order to be at school on time. Like the downtown core, service along Lundy's Lane has been gutted with the use of WEGO and once again, the residents of this city have been put at the back of the bus so to speak, by forcing us to use the WEGO instead of a dedicated bus route for locals. \r\n While I am not impressed with the new system, I am less impressed by the reaction of our local politicians - from the mayor on down, who doesn't seem to see these problems, as we do. People who use transit are not second class citizens and should be accorded the same respect and concern for this serious problem in our city.  Having lived in other urban areas and dependent on public transit, I look at the transit system in Niagara and see a  system that worked but has been gutted at great cost and designed by outsiders with no knowledge of the unique challenges the Falls presents.  \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that our officials from the mayor on down to the Transit management give precedence to the visitors to this city, to the transportation of tourists but leaves the residents out in the cold...literally. These open houses are a good start but I really have to wonder if our concerns will be listened to. They can talk about bringing much needed jobs to this area but, if we have no way to get to them, what good are they?  Since ther eis a municipal election coming up this year, I will be asking candidates where they stand on this issue - one I feel that is a vital one to making Niagara Falls a great place not just to visit, but to live and work in.

Now there's only 2 buses that go downtown and if you work in the tourist area and you miss that bus then you have to wait another half hour before the next one comes along, with the old system at least there was a bus every 15 minutes or try taking one from Drummond and heading up to Thorold Stone, it's now double the time it use to be because you either have to go to the Target Plaza or Niagara Square first.  The main problem with this transit is letting people decide the routes and times who DON'T depend on the local transit to get around so what do they care as long as they keep the tourists happy is all that matters to them.  Personally I've started to boycott the transit all together and I encourage everyone to do the same, let this city's transit try to survive on just the tourist industry.","like_count":1,"author_name":"Cathy Hodge","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/83875378"},{"created_at":"2014-02-09T11:52:53Z","content":"this is not an effective system any more.","like_count":1,"author_name":"randy barkwill","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/79178437"},{"created_at":"2014-02-06T18:59:23Z","content":"I'm sick of waiting 30 mins at one stop, 15 at a another and STILL having to walk 15 mins home, there is ZERO service in my area, and there are tons of kids, in highschool that can't get home after their classes, or extra-curricular activities, which is probably what is keeping them from getting in situations they should not be in! As a wrestling coach of the local highschool, and a college student, i tremble to think that the kids i spend my time with coaching, have to trek home at night, in the freezing cold because there is no bus or help from this city. They say \"children are our future\" why don't you start thinking about how much you are not helping them, or us, the college and university individuals, by ruining the buses schedule. I can't get to classes on at 8:30 anymore, which money o the students in Welland can tell you is when our  mandatory laboratory work starts. I can't get home on time, can no longer make it to practice on time to help these children, and half the time i''m forced to leave early or walk an hour because the only bus that will take me remotely close to my area has stopped running. The bus drivers do not know what they are doing either, i myself along with 4 others and an elderly woman had to wait an hour in -16 weather, for a bus that just plain didn't come to our stop. Then when i call and ask about it, they are rude, unhelpful, and hang up on me. Does anyone honestly think this service if benefiting anyone?! What will happen when the summer arrives and we are overwhelmed with an increase of travelers. We thrive as a city and as individuals on the tourism we bring in, if we who live here cannot figure this out i highly doubt they will be able to,   which will raise even more issues. Mostly resulting in the with a loss of income to employees unable to get to work, and guests who are unhappy with their vacation, causing them to spend less money. I work in the heart of this industry, in a welcome center in Victoria Park, and i can guarantee a happy guest is a spending guest, and a happy employee is a hard working employee.

As a wrestling coach of the local highschool, and a college student, i tremble to think that the kids i spend my time with coaching, have to trek home at night, in the freezing cold because there is no bus or help from this city. They say \"children are our future\" why don't you start thinking about how much you are not helping them, or us, the college and university individuals, by ruining the buses schedule. I can't get to classes on at 8:30 anymore, which money o the students in Welland can tell you is when our  mandatory laboratory work starts. I can't get home on time, can no longer make it to practice on time to help these children, and half the time i''m forced to leave early or walk an hour because the only bus that will take me remotely close to my area has stopped running. The bus drivers do not know what they are doing either, i myself along with 4 others and an elderly woman had to wait an hour in -16 weather, for a bus that just plain didn't come to our stop. Then when i call and ask about it, they are rude, unhelpful, and hang up on me. Does anyone honestly think this service if benefiting anyone?! What will happen when the summer arrives and we are overwhelmed with an increase of travelers. We thrive as a city and as individuals on the tourism we bring in, if we who live here cannot figure this out i highly doubt they will be able to,   which will raise even more issues. Mostly resulting in the with a loss of income to employees unable to get to work, and guests who are unhappy with their vacation, causing them to spend less money. I work in the heart of this industry, in a welcome center in Victoria Park, and i can guarantee a happy guest is a spending guest, and a happy employee is a hard working employee.
