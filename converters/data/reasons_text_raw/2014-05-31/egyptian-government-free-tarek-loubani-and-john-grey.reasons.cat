He has worked extensively to provide volunteer medical care in conflict situations internationally and for refugees in Canada. Award-winning Toronto filmaker, writer, and educator, John Greyson, is a Professor at York University in the Department of Film. \r\n\r\nDr. Loubani and Professor Greyson were travelling to the Gaza Strip, where they are working on an international academic and medical collaboration between the University of Western Ontario and the main hospital in the Gaza Strip, the al-Shifa hospital. They arrived in Egypt on August 15th, and were held up from crossing into Gaza due to the conflict in Egypt. On the afternoon of Friday, August 16th, their contact in Canada received a call from Dr. Loubani, stating that: \"we are being arrested by Egyptian police.\" Their whereabouts have been unknown since, and colleagues and family are extremely worried for their safety. \r\n\r\nConditions in Egypt are extremely dangerous with accounts of widespread military and police violence. According to Amensty International \u201cunprecedented levels of violence have left more than 600 dead in Egypt\u201d, further Amnesty also notes a \u201cpattern of excessive and unwarranted lethal force used by the Egyptian authorities since the 25 January revolution\u201d. More than 4,000 people have been injured in recent days. \r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call for immediate consular intervention to ascertain the whereabouts, conditions and secure the immediate safety and release of Dr. Loubani and Professor Greyson.

TRUE, in the Middle East, you can be neither friends or enemies with anyone.

Meanwhile, cancel all travel to these insane countries, by any and all Canadians, until these people get their act together.  After a year of missing our tourist dollars, and foreign aid, they will shape up over there.  Surely we can deal with our own people, and they can deal with theirs.

He has worked extensively to provide volunteer medical care in conflict situations internationally and for refugees in Canada. Award-winning Toronto filmaker, writer, and educator, John Greyson, is a Professor at York University in the Department of Film. \r\n\r\nDr. Loubani and Professor Greyson were travelling to the Gaza Strip, where they are working on an international academic and medical collaboration between the University of Western Ontario and the main hospital in the Gaza Strip, the al-Shifa hospital. They arrived in Egypt on August 15th, and were held up from crossing into Gaza due to the conflict in Egypt. On the afternoon of Friday, August 16th, their contact in Canada received a call from Dr. Loubani, stating that: \"we are being arrested by Egyptian police.\" Their whereabouts have been unknown since, and colleagues and family are extremely worried for their safety. \r\n\r\nConditions in Egypt are extremely dangerous with accounts of widespread military and police violence. According to Amensty International \u201cunprecedented levels of violence have left more than 600 dead in Egypt\u201d, further Amnesty also notes a \u201cpattern of excessive and unwarranted lethal force used by the Egyptian authorities since the 25 January revolution\u201d. More than 4,000 people have been injured in recent days. \r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call for immediate consular intervention to ascertain the whereabouts, conditions and secure the immediate safety and release of Dr. Loubani and Professor Greyson.

His compassion and ability to place patients at ease is something I aspire to as a physician. His dedication to his humanitarian efforts overseas is inspiring and his intentions have only been honourable. There are not too many people that would leave the comfort of their Western lifestyle to help others overseas. Moreover, he demonstrates this commitment daily through his lifestyle in London, Ontario and embodies selflessness. He is an asset to the ER in London and to the medical and refugee community at large. Please pressure the Egyptian government to reconsider this unfair incarceration by providing Tarek and John a fair trial and releasing him from prison.","like_count":1,"author_name":"Maria Tambakis","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/61054392"},{"created_at":"2013-09-08T01:08:40Z","content":"These are good guys.","like_count":1,"author_name":"Grayce Gadson","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/7257975"},{"created_at":"2013-09-21T00:38:15Z","content":"This is obviously a mistake.

He has worked extensively to provide volunteer medical care in conflict situations internationally and for refugees in Canada. Award-winning Toronto filmaker, writer, and educator, John Greyson, is a Professor at York University in the Department of Film. \r\n\r\nDr. Loubani and Professor Greyson were travelling to the Gaza Strip, where they are working on an international academic and medical collaboration between the University of Western Ontario and the main hospital in the Gaza Strip, the al-Shifa hospital. They arrived in Egypt on August 15th, and were held up from crossing into Gaza due to the conflict in Egypt. On the afternoon of Friday, August 16th, their contact in Canada received a call from Dr. Loubani, stating that: \"we are being arrested by Egyptian police.\" Their whereabouts have been unknown since, and colleagues and family are extremely worried for their safety. \r\n\r\nConditions in Egypt are extremely dangerous with accounts of widespread military and police violence. According to Amensty International \u201cunprecedented levels of violence have left more than 600 dead in Egypt\u201d, further Amnesty also notes a \u201cpattern of excessive and unwarranted lethal force used by the Egyptian authorities since the 25 January revolution\u201d. More than 4,000 people have been injured in recent days. \r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, ask the Canadian Government to continue to work with the Egyptian Embassy and officials in Egypt to ensure the safety and secure the immediate release of Dr. Loubani and Professor Greyson.

He has worked extensively to provide volunteer medical care in conflict situations internationally and for refugees in Canada. Award-winning Toronto filmaker, writer, and educator, John Greyson, is a Professor at York University in the Department of Film.\r\n\r\nDr. Loubani and Professor Greyson were travelling to the Gaza Strip, where they are working on an international academic and medical collaboration between the University of Western Ontario and the main hospital in the Gaza Strip, the al-Shifa hospital. They arrived in Egypt on August 15th, and were held up from crossing into Gaza due to the conflict in Egypt. On the afternoon of Friday, August 16th, their contact in Canada received a call from Dr. Loubani, stating that: \"we are being arrested by Egyptian police.\" Their whereabouts have been unknown since, and colleagues and family are extremely worried for their safety.\r\n\r\nConditions in Egypt are extremely dangerous with accounts of widespread military and police violence. According to Amensty International \u201cunprecedented levels of violence have left more than 600 dead in Egypt\u201d, further Amnesty also notes a \u201cpattern of excessive and unwarranted lethal force used by the Egyptian authorities since the 25 January revolution\u201d. More than 4,000 people have been injured in recent days.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, ask the Canadian Government to continue to work with the Egyptian Embassy and officials in Egypt to ensure the safety and secure the immediate release of Dr. Loubani and Professor Greyson. Our thoughts are with the many people in Egypt who have been arrested, beaten and killed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAlen Kaikcija","like_count":0,"author_name":"Alen Kaikcija","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/63305751"},{"created_at":"2013-09-06T18:07:20Z","content":"Apart from stressing the consular obligations of Canada's foreign service, the petition implicitly emphasizes the indiscriminate and brutal nature of the security strategy of Egypt's military in preventing theocracy there.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Peter Penz","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/61636392"},{"created_at":"2013-08-23T09:15:06Z","content":"I sign this as a Canadian abroad for Canadians abroad, and they need to be able to come home.
