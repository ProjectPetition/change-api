Not to mention the many local walkers/joggers/bikers who cross from one side of Headline  to the other in order to get to the bike path. It took how many years (and how many unfortunate and preventable deaths) for the light to go up on the corner of McConnell and South Branch - too many people I knew were victims of accidents there and I would really hate for something more to happen at the corner of Headline and 138 in order to see a light go up! I understand that by having a light put up will not eliminate ALL accidents, but it will at least help the flow of traffic and drivers to maintain their speed and be more alert.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Amanda Rudy","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/63025526"},{"created_at":"2013-11-06T21:00:06Z","content":"I travel this road everyday.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Elise Caron","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/68255539"},{"created_at":"2013-11-06T20:25:57Z","content":"I Drove this road almost weekly with my kids for hockey games and it is very dangerous","like_count":0,"author_name":"Lynn Tourangeau","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/68249864"},{"created_at":"2013-11-07T14:35:35Z","content":"I've seen on average 2-3 serious accidents a year at this corner.
