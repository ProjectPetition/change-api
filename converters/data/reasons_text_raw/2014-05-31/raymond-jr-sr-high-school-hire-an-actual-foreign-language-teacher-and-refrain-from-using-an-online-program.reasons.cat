Grammar rules as you know it get thrown out the window and replaced with foreign concepts. Alphabets and characters are often different, too. I've tried learning languages from programs and I never got past plain vocabulary. Learning grammer, slang, trends, etc must be learned from an actual human teacher so the student can be immersed in the language. I find it appalling that a public high school thinks it is acceptable to teach students via computer programs instead of hiring an actual teacher. The student himself says it makes it difficult and is easier for students to cheat with the program in charge. I think the school is cheating the students out of having the opportunity to learn a valuable skill, a foreign language. Another public education fail. SIGNED and shared.","like_count":1,"author_name":"bonnie garrity","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/14220605"},{"created_at":"2013-11-11T20:19:08Z","content":"The quality of  public school education should not not be sacrificed in order to save money--especially when so much money is wasted on trivial acquisitions in the Public Education Department..","like_count":1,"author_name":"Lynne Treat","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/6870065"},{"created_at":"2013-11-11T17:34:40Z","content":"Only a human can cope with questions and feedback.
