Both feminists, & those who would not apply that label to themselves, among my friends, know that from Biblical times to the world of screen fiction, strong, capable women are heroic figures.  Even if you're not an MTV viewer, I think this oversight goes beyond demographics. We can all find women to look up to, whatever our worldview---egalitarians to complementarians. Say no to MTV's narrowly defined nominees, by expanding the category to include more options, or adding a category recognizing heroines, as well.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Cathy Sparks","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/13536655"},{"created_at":"2014-04-10T02:27:21Z","content":"Of course!
