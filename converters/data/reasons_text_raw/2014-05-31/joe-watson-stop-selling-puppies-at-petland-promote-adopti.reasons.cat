The dogs are kept in the tiniest of cages and get no exercise or cleaning. The place smells horrible and is extremely cramped for there to be so many different types of animals there. They charge thousands of dollars for their animals and in this economy no one can afford that so they are barely being sold and eventually shipped off to the pound. We need more places like the SPCA who wants to love their animals while they are with them.

In addition to the puppies, I witnessed the iguanas not being properly taken care of. For iguanas to grow and stay healthy, they need heat and light sources. When I asked the store why they didn't have the lamp on in the cage, I was told that it had broke. Yet, they were selling the lights right next to the cage. The fact that they can't risk losing $5 or so to keep their pets alive is ridiculous.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Victoria Katz","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/90195396"},{"created_at":"2014-04-25T10:43:23Z","content":"Pets are not something you window shop for. They are lifetime long friends, who deserve to be given the best life possible. When they start their lives off by loving in a glass box when they should be feeling the grass between their toes, getting vet attention, being socialized, and being cuddled to sleep is truly a tragedy. Makes me sick.

The last experience I had was just terrible, the dogs were laying In their own urine, It had seemed that they weren't properly fed right from the looks of some of the animals. I Immediately asked to speak to the manager about the situation and after waiting 15mins I left the store with disgust,frustration and disappointment. We absolutely need to help these Animals Into a better environment where they will be loved and better taken care of. I'll do anything I can to help!! Lets change this and save these Animals.
