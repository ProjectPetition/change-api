It strikes me as a little underhanded. If there are to be pathways added, I think they need to be environmentally friendly options - if not mulch, than some sort of open grid framework option that allows grass/groundcover to grow within it. I think the asphalt path is a cheap, short-sighted solution to a problem that I'm not even sure exists, outside of the once-a-year event (Art in the Park) and I urge the city planners to more homework on the proposals to do what is best for the park, not what is cheapest/easiest for the maintenance crew.","like_count":2,"author_name":"Deborah Buckner","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/78343512"},{"created_at":"2014-01-01T22:04:37Z","content":"As a long-ago graduate of Walkerville Collegiate, I love and respect the character of old Walkerville, and do NOT want to change the charcater of Willistread Park nor harm the flora and fauna of this beautiful park.

I feel as though the city following through with their plans and not listening to residents and community members of Walkerville really sends a strong message to our youth and young adults, that it does not matter about your roots and where you come from, but rather that conforming and not questioning the change to the those in power is what you should do and are going to do. This park has been in public use and the pinnacle of the Walkerville area and community since 1921! IT WAS THE FIRST DESIGNATED, PROTECTED LAND PLACED UNDER THE ONTARIO HERITAGE ACT, HOW CAN YOU JUST STRIP IT OF IT'S SIGNIFICANTS?? It's just though similar to when people begin to lose touch of their cultural roots and traditions over time to our western culture. People should be PROUD of where they're from and try to preserve and share their wonderful heritage, rather than conforming and uniforming to what has been set forth for us. Just like people, parklands, grounds, houses, communities and neighbourhoods are all meant to be diverse and different, this is what makes a community RICH, WEALTHY AND DIVERSE.\r\nThe local community of Walkerville was not taken into consideration when council had arrived to their decision. No one has made any mention to the accessibility issues that will and may arise for the community. The new 10' wide pathways form the north to south entrances of the gate are even longer than they were before, due to the winding of proposed path, as opposed to the straight, direct already laid out path. With the larger path and the city's intention to have trucks driving on it, how is this any safer or more accessible for those on foot, in wheelchairs, using walkers, those with children etc. By having this wide width pathway you now have open the door to vehicles and modes of transportation that such as motorized scooters, e-bikes and an increase volume in cyclists which has now has become an increased pedestrian safety issue. \r\nThe city council also never took into consideration the accessibility issue of parking for those of us that LIVE HERE. I love Art in the Park but I do not love having to stake out my spot on the street and leave my car tied up all weekend long due to the lack of parking, especially parking that we pay for in our taxes. I should not have to walk 3 blocks just to get to my front door due to the sheer volume of people related to the increase in events. The City of Windsor plans to and has already scheduled the beer festival to take in the park. With this being said no one has taken increase of noise for the entire neighbourhood, not to mention especially for those who live directly across the park into consideration either. Too many inconsiderations for our community, heritage, history, people and land. Art in the Park is an event that may come and go and may not be here forever but our land and culture will be! Please take some pride and please stop thinking with this cheap, fiscal \"saving\" budget, especially at the cost of our roots.","like_count":1,"author_name":"Jackie Giannotti Amaro","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/93152748"},{"created_at":"2014-03-09T20:40:53Z","content":"I am a frequent visitor to Walkerville and originally a Winsorite.","like_count":1,"author_name":"Gregory Quenneville","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/83898490"},{"created_at":"2014-03-16T17:17:08Z","content":"Because the City isn't thinking right.","like_count":1,"author_name":"William Baker","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/86098858"},{"created_at":"2014-01-05T04:34:15Z","content":"Leave the park in its current state.\r\nDon't make it a commercial venue for Art in the Park.","like_count":1,"author_name":"Jim Walsh","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/75056195"},{"created_at":"2014-01-03T00:17:39Z","content":"I grew up in Windsor and love to visit Willistead Park whenever I can.
