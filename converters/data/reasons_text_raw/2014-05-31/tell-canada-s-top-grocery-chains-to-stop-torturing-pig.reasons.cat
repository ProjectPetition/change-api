I for one will not step foot in any of your stores until you immediately stop buying pork from suppliers that  have absolutely no respect or consideration for the well being of these sentient animals who feel pain, joy,  misery and who suffer immensely from this sadistic form of animal cruelty.\r\nThe ball is in your courts.\r\nDo the right thingstop buying tortured pig parts now.","like_count":0,"author_name":"susan manns","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/564907"},{"created_at":"2012-12-10T21:27:11Z","content":"Horrible, des vrais sanguinaires, tortionnaires !!","like_count":0,"author_name":"BETARD Claude","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/11834961"},{"created_at":"2012-12-28T02:19:48Z","content":"It's just not right.

Food has also become marketed & fashionable. We decide what to make for dinner before going to the store. We should be basing our meals on what is available - not having every kind of animal and fish at our fingertips. Years ago you would go to the butcher and you would buy what he had and that's what you made for dinner. Not vice versa. Food should not be marketed as a way to make money - food is a necessity. To exploit animals for the sake of monetary gain is wrong and is just greed. There is no need to raise animals like this and it is ethically not right to do so.

My heart goes out to these animals that never asked to be born, and are helpless and totally dependent on the kindness of man. And these animals have far more sensitivity and even humanity than any owner/operator/worker that is responsible for this atrocity. That means, anyone in the business. You don't deserve the kindness that these animals deserve.

I think pigs are  more capable of conscious thought and compassion than the humans who believe they are not torturing pigs.  I think members of the Canadian government who do not think this act is inhumane or just do not think it an important issue, should be penned in the same manner as our pigs for a one month period and write an essay afterward on why they don't want to be treated like a pig and why pigs will no longer be tortured by the manner in which they are kept.\r\nI think the Canadian government has a lot to learn from pigs.

I am in so much pain all over my body. Can I take a break please?\" and perhaps someone would have mercy, instead of seeing them as dumb pigs who are only on this earth for the man to use. No rights.

TAKE the step and consider their torture while you sleep in your warm bed at night. CARE about the companies you buy your meat supplies from. Do your research. It's the bare minimum. How are the animals being treated before they are left to die a slow death, confused laying on the filthy floor of a noisy factory, never knowing what it's like to play or lay in the sun.

Showing complete disregard for animal life is a marker to the decline of our civilization and fragmentation of some of our most cherished values. When one producer/farmer allows willfully or unwittingly this type of behaviour towards animals, he/she tarnishes a whole industry, as if a malignant tumour was to find its way into our society. When this is brought to light, it also points to the authories' lack of thoroughness in dealing with such issue. The guilt is shared, it's great shame, but it is not unrepairable. new measures should be placed and offenders dealt with accordingly. I am glad I stumbled on this video and that someone took the courage to bring this out in the open. The industry just lost a customer with me.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Guillaume Peribere","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/21295100"},{"created_at":"2012-12-11T19:22:42Z","content":"Hard to believe this is happening in Canada...","like_count":0,"author_name":"Sinead Archbold","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/36386908"},{"created_at":"2012-12-21T01:25:44Z","content":"We must speak for those that can't speak for themselves ...","like_count":0,"author_name":"Steve F","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/26683489"},{"created_at":"2012-12-21T02:42:57Z","content":"If you are what you eat, we're all quite tortured on the inside.

There is no excuse for the way people treat farm animals today.  The cruel and sick way farm animals are treated form the darkest chapter of history.  When people do not feel compassion for other living creatures, compassion drops greatly as it is today.  Anyone who has accustomed himself to regard the life of any living creature as worthless is in danger of arriving also at the idea of worthless human lives and is being proven today.  This factor Is being proven today.  This evolution of cruelty is spreading like a virus.   We must fight against the spirit of unconscious cruelty with which we treat the animals. Animals suffer as much as we do. True humanity does not allow us to impose such sufferings on them so those that work at these sick places are desensitized to the pain and suffering they are causing.  It is our duty to make the whole world recognize it. Until we extend our circle of compassion to all living things, humanity will not find peace. \r\n\r\nAnimals have a God Given Right to be here and not to abuse, torture, and kill.

Hence I was deeply saddened to read these reports of inhumane practices among Canadian pork suppliers. For me and many other Americans, Canada has been a beacon and an inspiration on so many issues, from human rights to care for our environment. On this issue, however, Canada seems to be far behind. I think we can all agree that raising animals for consumption in a more humane way is better for the animals, better for the people who care for them, and better for the people who eat them. More humane farming practices mean that farmers don't have to use antibiotics as extensively, and as we are reminded all too frequently, agricultural antibiotic use can be dangerous, creating antibiotic resistance that can transfer to human pathogens. In many other cases, farmers have found that humane rearing practices make their animals more productive, and consumers are generally glad to know that the animal they are about to eat lived a pain-free life that more closely approximated its natural thriving. Please, please do not reward these cruel and unsustainable practices with your business. Use of gestation crates is bad farming and bad business, and totally beneath the dignity of a nation that is otherwise so enlightened. Please take leadership on this issue.

It is horrible the way That pig factory farmers treat these animals. They don't eat natural foods either. The farmers want to use the least amount of money possible. They don't think about what is best for the animal. They resort sometimes to feeding the pigs manure or waste, other dead pig carcases or pig meat. They pump the pigs with antibiotics and hormones so they will grow faster and produce more meat. And when we eat these pigs, we are digesting the hormones, antibiotics and waste that the pigs ate, which is unhealthy for us too.  farmers don't care how they treat the animals. They treat them as if they aren't living, as if they are inanimate objects. How would we feel lying in a cage on a cement floor, in dark room unable to see sunlight or even move? Imagine that for just a day. Well, that is how these pigs live. Except they live in that kind of environment for a lifetime. They don't ever get to live like normal animals. They don't even get to be outside. They don't get to run, they don't even get to move. The farmers of these pigs know how cruel they are treating them. But it means getting more meat, which is more money. I strongly believe\r\nin putting a stop to this kind of torture. The least we can do is to buy only pork that we know has been treated well and not support companies that torture the animals. We can help put a stop to it, and get grocery chains to stop supporting these companies. We can put an end to gestation crates, and pigs can live happier lives.\r\n","like_count":0,"author_name":"K M","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/35047491"},{"created_at":"2012-12-10T23:14:45Z","content":"This is absolutely disgusting, barbaric,cruel and sick.

They went for a hike, I stayed behind to sit on the porch and read while I played with some kittens. Two biiig sows came from opposite sides of the cabin and started snuffling my hair and generally harassing me. I do love animals, so we played for a few minutes before a thunderstorm moved in and it was so violent that the rain was sideways, the sky was as dark as I've ever seen it, and you could see each lightning fork. I grabbed the kitten and ran inside the cabin. I heard a noise and turned around to see both sows standing nervously in the kitchenette area. You've never seen pigs look so big, or a kitchenette look so small. They were both scared, comforting each other and staring at me. Finally, one of them stepped forward and leaned her head against me, like she was concerned that I was scared like she and her friend were. I wasn't scared, of course, but I hugged her head and scratched her ears until the other sow came over to snuggle as well. The storm was over as soon as it started, and as I checked out the window to see what the weather was doing, I heard the door swing open, and turned to watch the duo let themselves out, casting bit doe-eyed smiles back at me. I love and respect all animals, but animals that show me compassion... It leaves a mark. People are outraged by puppy-mills, so it is utterly beyond my comprehension that torturing pigs in far worse ways is just fine. A \"turn the other way\" situation. All for the great god bacon, at that. No animal deserves to be treated the way they are at factory farms. Just because they \"taste good\" doesn't mean it's okay to turn a blind eye to their suffering before they end up in your double cheeseburger.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Allysen Dupler","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/36538948"},{"created_at":"2012-12-13T20:50:52Z","content":"I cannot begin to say how disgusted I am, yet again, by the inhumane treatment of animals in this country.

Employed by an animal rights group, Darrel was required to act normal, do what he was told, and participate, if necessary, in killing animals. It seems like Darrel may be haunted because there was that little space in his brain that told him he could blow it all in seconds, if he broke the agreement he had with Mercy for Animals ... if only perhaps he had just grabbed that individual pig, 46257, put her on a front loader, loaded her into the back of his car, and taken her to an emergency animal hospital, he would have been fired from the factory farm he was investigating and as well, fired from Mercy for Animals. I can see why he is haunted. This farm was so horrific that Darrel will now have nightmares for the rest of his life, and will always wonder what the outcome would have been had he followed his heart and not his paycheck and his principle, just like all the other employees do at the factory pig farm in Manitoba, and made a difference in that poor, defenseless pig's life.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Amanda Sorvino","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/801715"},{"created_at":"2012-12-20T21:25:07Z","content":"Life is important.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Jonathan Tang","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/36115436"},{"created_at":"2012-12-20T21:34:23Z","content":"All animals deserve humanity ","like_count":0,"author_name":"Erin Andrews","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/37037530"},{"created_at":"2012-12-09T14:22:39Z","content":"Animals desserve our respect.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Nicole  brien","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/12802556"},{"created_at":"2012-12-21T00:22:14Z","content":"it's just wromg","like_count":0,"author_name":"Robert Wozney","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/32709452"},{"created_at":"2012-12-13T20:53:25Z","content":"I have stopped eating pork, and will never buy it again.
