Basically I'm paying sony money to host games using MY OWN INTERNET CONNECTION.\r\n\r\nThis scam all started with xbox live gold and with people who gladly payed a fee so microsoft could use peoples own internet connection to host mutiplayer games. This is why mutiplayer usually would suffer from lag or the player who was \"host\" would have an advantage over other players. Even more insane was how microsoft started putting ads on the dashboard and claimed it was to \"fund xbox live\". \r\n\r\nIf we don't explain to people how Sony is literally charging you money to host online multiplayer using your own internet connection and tell others to stop paying for PS+ just to play online multiplayer  then this will soon become the norm.\r\n\r\nI don't want all the other crap that i don't need that's included in PS+, I just want to play online multiplayer for free, just like how it was before and how it should be.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Matt Elliott","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/91421351"}]}
