Not to many romance storylines out there speak volume especially storylines that focus on sideline characters from a show. They are usually the one's overlooked just for the sake of focusing on the main characters. Klaus and Caroline are parallel in a lot ways. I'd give a list but it'd be huge. I understand it the characters need to grow separately before they can come together but ruining characters is not the way to go. Klaus has never shown true affection for another woman in a long time suddenly he falls in love now he's checking out the next chick that comes by. Out of character, Caroline I can understand it she's young in college still learning to live and learn. But to ignore this on TO is not exactly the best idea it's like Caroline never existed to Caroline. The guy is vindictive he never lets go of his need for revenge than along comes Caroline and he's able to put that need away for her. Tyler and Katherine are both alive because Klaus's love for her surpassed his obsession with revenge. Klaroline is the best version of beauty and the beast ive seen I want more.","like_count":1,"author_name":"Nicole Sheehey","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/77498089"},{"created_at":"2014-02-08T12:40:52Z","content":"Klarolike are meant to be!","like_count":1,"author_name":"Noor Wazar","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/78983188"},{"created_at":"2014-02-08T17:05:42Z","content":"They are the perfect couple..their love is so strong you can feel it when they breath.Even though they are just fictional xp But they are meant to be !!
