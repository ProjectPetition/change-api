First, those things change with time and sometimes they don't change until someone asks for it, or a number people ask for it, and only then after a number people have been denied it, does the next person who asks finally get it. Second, I think this is another way that institutions are in power -- they know what they can really do and what they have done, they have the information that the candidate does not. So I don't think a candidate should be restricted by what the college says is negotiable.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Adriel Trott","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/86620720"},{"created_at":"2014-03-19T22:17:51Z","content":"I am currently on the job market for tenure-track philosophy positions, and generally concerned about Nazareth College's actions.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Adam Rosenfeld","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/86618115"},{"created_at":"2014-03-21T11:13:46Z","content":"It is well established that (for complex reasons) women are ess successful at negotiating salaries and perks than men.
