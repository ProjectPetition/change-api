It concerns me that when someone, anyone dares to question, they are criticized for having an agenda. Of course there is an agenda here; one that asks for transparency and accountability. So what's wrong with that? Why the resistence if everything is good?\r\n\r\nI assume the upgrade by S&P was based on financial information provided by the city. And cities never attempt to show themselves in a better light than is really the case in order to get a better rate on borrowing? Wouldn't you, as a taxpayer, want to know if what you are being told about the financial health of the city is actually the case and not just what someone wants you to think?\r\n\r\nIf the financial situation is revealed to be as taxpayers have been told, no harm, no foul. The process is there for a reason and this group seems to have some legitimate concerns. If things are not as they appear, I think it would be best to know that before the next election.\"","like_count":0,"author_name":"Craig Chamberlain","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/34861662"}]}
