However, you should not be drinking these \"sports drinks\" in the first place.  Did you know that HFCS and sucrose, the ingredients commonly used to sweeten \"sports drinks\" are toxic and are implicated in this country's high rates of obesity and diabetes?  These sweeteners are supposedly in these drinks to provide energy for the body.  Both sweeteners contain glucose which does provide the energy.  But the other part of these sweetener molecules contains fructose, which is mildly toxic.  Gatorade used to contain just glucose to provide energy, but glucose by itself is not very sweet and the drink did not taste very good, so the company used sucrose instead and later switched to HFCS because it's cheaper.  Before these energy drinks came on the market, athletes prepared for sports events by eating healthy meals which included fruits (not fruit juice!)  and vegetables.

I was alarmed to learn that Gatorade used harmful chemicals to color certain flavors, now I'm even more alarmed to have learned that I have been consuming \"BVO\" (whether the chemical is dangerous in this form is immaterial, it is an inorganic chemical that I do not want in my body). Thankfully, it seems Gatorade has acquiesced and as of late January PepsiCo, parent company of Gatorade products, has agreed to remove \"BVO\" from its product. Thank you Sarah, for further bringing this to the attention of the mainstream public. Since the mid-20th century, America has been under a \"spell\" that chemicals in our produce and food are for our betterment. The fact remains that our food and beverages, the very things that help our children grow, nourish us, should not last unnaturally with preservatives and artificial ingredients. Society is just beginning to experience the devastating effects on our environment and physical health from an antiquated mid 20th century ideal of better living through chemistry. Educating ourselves on what we purchase and consume is crucial in living a healthier life. Now, we need to stop the endless use of plastic in these products. Aside from the pollution they cause, plastic left in moderate heat will leak chemicals into the liquid it contains. Many experts have scientifically proven that water bottles left in cars leak a toxic chemical directly related to breast cancer and other ailments (Sheryl Crow brought this to the forefront when she was diagnosed with breast cancer). Petitions such as these can only benefit everyone in the long run.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Cory Dorschel","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/cjd2112"}]}

However, Gatorade is responsive to public input about the toxins they allow in their drinks--can you rise to this responsiveness? \r\nConsumers are learning we have to be informed about ingredients--this trend is only expanding--because of the outright plethora of toxins allowed in our food and drink. \r\nWe need real nutrition without toxins. And we are willing to inform ourselves and each other in order to protect one another.\r\nDid you know Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the United States instead of heart disease? \r\nPlease consider your customers, the source of your profits, and get toxins out of your \"Poweraid\" including BVO, HFCS, \"artificial flavors\" and \"artificial colors\" all known to be hormone disruptors or carcinogens (we don't believe industry lies, studies payed for by the industry whose intention is profit over truth and over health.)\r\nEither be responsive to your consumers, or, the longer you wait to provide less-toxic drinks, the more engendered your reputation will become for being sluggish in removing toxins known to cause hormone disruption and fertility problems. \r\nConsumers don't want BVO and every day you keep it in your drink makes us trust you less--and this distrust may last longer than you had anticipated.\r\nJoin the 21st century; consumers are waking up to the fact WE have to monitor what corporations put in our so-called food and drinks, because so many and so highly toxic ingredients are allowed by law. Because of this trend, corporations who respond to public pressure (to remove toxic contents--seems like we shouldn't have to put pressure on you not to poison us) in the long run will fare better financially, because consumers talk to each other, and because of the number and toxicity of ingredients, this trend will expand so people can keep some of the numerous toxins in our water, drinks and food out of our bodies. Best respond now than permanently lose business because you insist on poisoning us (this is what it comes down to). \r\nNo BVO. No HFCS, no artificial ingredients or colors. Feed your own kid on this stuff if you think it's safe, and find out what happens. Or be intelligent, reasonable, and responsive to public outcry for less toxic drinks--this is your decision, just as purchasing and ingesting drinks without toxins is our (consumer) decision.
