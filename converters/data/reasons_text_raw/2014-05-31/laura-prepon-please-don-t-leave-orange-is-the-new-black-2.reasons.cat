I heard that Jenji Kohan created each  ingenious character with such individuality and I didn't believe it, until I watched the first episode. I was captivated by each character that I despised, rooted for and felt apathy towards. Even though Piper was the main character, I never found myself feeling anything for her, but I went from disliking Alex Vaus, to loving her misunderstood and honest, no scratch that, virtuous complex. I fell in love  with the modest role that is Alex Vaus, played by Laura Prepon and for her to leave is something that would change, if not kill the entire flux of this mind-blowing series. So, Laura Prepon... I doubt you are going to be reading this, but just in case you might be, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE. I love Alex Vaus and there is so much more to her that needs to be shown on the upcoming episodes.
