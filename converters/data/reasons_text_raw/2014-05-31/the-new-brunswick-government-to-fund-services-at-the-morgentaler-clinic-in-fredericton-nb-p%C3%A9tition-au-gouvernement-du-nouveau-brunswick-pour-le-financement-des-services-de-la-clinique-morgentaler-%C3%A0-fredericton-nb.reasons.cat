I was a foster child, now I am a forty-ish woman, with a degree in structural social work; I have expertise as a scientist in addition to a lifetime of lived experience on this subject. Limiting choices will undeniably lead to an increase in unplanned pregnancies resulting in babies born who may severely suffer the fate of being unwanted children, and I can assure you, NO ONE should EVER have to live that way.\r\nOur child protective services and foster care system in Canada is already overburdened. The numbers of Crown Wards/foster kids/adopted children who become statistics in \"the system\" under the category of child deaths reported in Western provinces is shocking. It's sickening that any provincial/federal government would even think about making such a stupid decision. Think about the human cost - the emotional damage it does to a child who has lived, knowing they are not wanted by their parent(s). Or unloved. Unwelcome. Neglected. Abused.\r\n\r\nHow long would you live before you start seriously considering suicide?\r\n \r\nI think abortion clinics are a necessity in Canada. We are a multi-cultural country, and you must consider how immigrants may view an unwanted pregnancy - for example, a 20 year-old, unmarried Muslim woman - how do you think her parents/siblings may respond?I think by not funding abortion clinics in New Brunswick, and the rest of Canada, it demonstrates a total lack of understanding of long-term economic impact the tax-payer is burdened with. Refusing to initiate, or pulling away existing funding from any abortion clinic(s) in New Brunswick, when this is already the poorest province in the country is not economically advantageous for us. New Brunswickers will be making a very expensive mistake to oppose abortion clinics - it is the government's responsibility to explain why this is needed in our society today. We are not living in the early 1900's, we need to keep up with reality in our legal process and government processes, if we want to advance naturally in our education, health and social progression. Otherwise, this government has done a great disservice to the people it represents, and has put us behind even farther than we are now.

Not only is charging a fee for abortion illegal, as it contravenes the Morgentaler Supreme Court decision of 1988 and the Canada Health Act, it undermines the constitutional rights and freedoms of women and serves as a barrier that further marginalizes those who are already in a vulnerable and precarious socioeconomic position. Free access to family planning tools is essential to improving the standard of living for women, their families, and communities. For taxpayers, the financial costs associated with compliance with the Morgentaler Supreme Court decision of 1988 and the Canada Health Act are negligible when compared with the ongoing economic and societal burdens that result from depriving women of the right to delay motherhood until such time as they feel that they are mentally, physically, and financially prepared.\r\nThe Office of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada have set \u201cPromote Gender Equality and Empower Women\u201d, \u201cImprove Maternal Health\u201d, and \u201cEradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger\u201d as Millennium Development Goals for 2015.

This province creates a stigma against a woman's right to choose to bare a child or not...

If men had to carry children for the duration of a pregnancy there would be a clinic on every corner, in every airport and shopping mall. With the majority of men VS. women in political authority it is no wonder things are so backwards. I'll be damned if I let a man tell me how to run my life... So why does a male majority government have the authority to dictate what social classes have access to clinics? Who speaks for us? Why are the costs of contraceptives so high, yet if a woman opts for a hysterectomy she is refused, and has to pay for abortions?

My point is this; the young girls and women who need this procedure the most are quite often the ones who cannot afford to pay for it out of pocket and because of this they end up paying for it for the rest of their lives.

After countless phone calls, texts and emails, we figured the best choice for her and her future would be to get an abortion.

There are many young girls all over Canada becoming pregnant and are unable to safely raise a child which is why I would like to see this clinic stay open for other girls and women with a crisis.

I was fortunate in that my only unexpected pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, which cost me nothing. Don't misunderstand me. The experience was a sad and painful period. I mourned the child and felt tremendous loss. However, at the time, I was practicing safe sex with the use of birth control. I did not want children.

It was so intense! Some \u201cAnti-Choice\u201d people had signs that read \"Choose Life\" and \"Abortion is Murder\" ...glad to see they recognize that it is in fact a CHOICE! Not to mention, abortions are legal so making the CHOICE to have one is not murder, since murder is a punishable criminal offence.\r\n\r\nIt's time to change the way we talk about this issue. It shouldn't be \"Pro-Life versus Pro-Choice\" anymore. The conversation should focus on the already legal procedure remaining legal and more accessible to keep women safe and healthy.\r\n\r\nLET\u2019S BEGIN...\r\nI think people don't understand what \u201cPro-Choice\u201d means. \u201cPro-Choice\u201d is not a synonym for \u201cPro-Abortion\u201d; those are two entirely different things. \u201cPro-Choice\u201d simply means that you believe in a human being having the CHOICE, the OPTION, to seek a medical professional for an abortion; having the CHOICE to put their child up for adoption; or having the CHOICE to keep the child. It is all about CHOICES. Each person will CHOOSE what to believe in, whom and what to support, and will CHOOSE to pass judgment and make decisions for those whose lives and CHOICES we will not understand. I think that this is a very dangerous mistake and unfortunately it will hurt New Brunswick in the long term.\r\n\r\nI do not agree with the use of abortion as a form of birth control; however, what another woman chooses to do with her body is none of my business. I will not tell her that she cannot make the CHOICE to terminate the pregnancy just the same as she will not tell me that I cannot CHOOSE to carry to term. From one woman to another my responsibility is to support her in the CHOICE she makes, because it is her right to make that CHOICE and I will not try to take it from her. I think that women need to stand up for this service, even if they don\u2019t believe in abortions. (Sounds crazy, I know!) But this closure affects all women, even those who will never have an abortion and those who cannot conceive. That said, however, it is not just a women\u2019s issue; women everywhere need support from male counterparts on this issue.\r\n\r\nMaking the decision to have an abortion (to terminate a pregnancy) takes a lot of thought; she must weigh out pros and cons and consider her options before the decision is made. I think people assume that a woman who has an abortion must have found it easy to make that CHOICE, but in reality, the woman does suffer from it. She undergoes physical and mental trauma and many often seek counseling to deal with the emotional turmoil they experience.\r\n\r\nHaving the CHOICE to seek a medical professional for an abortion should remain legal and accessible to keep women healthy and safe. Women, throughout time, have managed to find ways and means of having abortions, and keeping it a legal, available, and safe procedure will keep many women alive. \r\n\r\nFrankly, if the province's Dept. of Education would start teaching Sexual Education rather than attempting to promote \"Abstinence Only\", young teens, and other aged women, might not have unexpected pregnancies. Not to mention, I think birth control (contraceptives, condoms, etc) should be FREE so that each person has access to it, and with that, the number of unplanned pregnancies would decline. I really do believe that better Sex. Ed and accessible methods of birth control will help as the number of women who seek the aid of a professional to perform an abortion will decline. While this is an incredibly controversial and sensitive topic, most people are not thinking of every possible situation, or the consequences of their actions and thought processes, and those inactions of the province of New Brunswick. Don't be too closed minded, folks! Challenge the province! Fight back! It is the only way that things will improve!","like_count":0,"author_name":"Michelle Wight","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/89372608"},{"created_at":"2014-04-14T15:05:41Z","content":"Because in Canada womem have the right to choose.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Kendall Lively","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/89620513"},{"created_at":"2014-04-15T14:19:56Z","content":"All Canadian women deserve the same medical care that I am able to receive as an Ontarian.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Allye Vice","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/11652694"},{"created_at":"2014-04-11T19:26:29Z","content":"Because I am pro-choice!

What about those of  us who make well below the poverty line, even working 6 days a week? If a person cannot afford the almost $1000 it costs to have an abortion, who in their right mind would think that same woman could afford to raise a child until the age of 18? People may argue that they could give the baby up for adoption, but what if that woman does not want their child to end up in the foster system. the world is so overpopulated already, why bring another life into it if you are not able or willing to provide for it. Yes, some may try to use it as a form of birth control, but what about the ones who would use it responsibly. For example, if A condom breaks and no one noticed, or if there is a crazy/jealous boyfriend involved and they put pin holes in the condom to trap their girlfriend in the relationship by getting her pregnant. These are both very real possibilities and I do not believe that these women should be denied the help they are seeking.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Cortney McAdam","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/87064436"},{"created_at":"2014-03-10T05:20:26Z","content":"Because it is.
