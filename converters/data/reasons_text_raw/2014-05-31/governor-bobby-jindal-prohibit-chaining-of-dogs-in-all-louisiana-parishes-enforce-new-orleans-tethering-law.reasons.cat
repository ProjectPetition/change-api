Shelter must be placed in a dry area free of debris, feces, and standing water. It must have at least three sides and a weatherproof roof; have a solid sanitary floor, be adequately ventilated; provide shelter from wind, rain, sun and the elements at all times. Suitable drainage must be provided so that water is not standing in or around the shelter.\u2028(2) Shelter must be large enough for the animal to stand, turn around, and lie down without touching the sides or top of the shelter.\u2028(3) When outdoor temperatures reach freezing levels, all cats, dogs, and small domestic animals must be moved indoors or to an area that provides heat and shelter from the weather.\u2028(4) All areas where animals are kept shall be cleaned regularly so that fecal matter is disposed of so not to attract insects or rodents, become unsightly or cause objectionable odor.\u2028(5) An animal control officer may remove an animal that is living in conditions that do not meet standards outlined in 18-2.1. If modifications to the shelter or living area do not meet the standards within five business days, that animal becomes the property of the LA/SPCA.\u2028(6) If multiple animals are present in one location, each animal must have a separate and clean food bowl. Each animal must have access to shelter and the owner must meet all standards as detailed in this section.\r\n(b) Tethering. No animal shall be tethered as a primary means of stationary confinement; stationary confinement by tethering shall be considered cruel treatment.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe following communities have banned or \"regulated\" chaining in their animal protection ordinances.
