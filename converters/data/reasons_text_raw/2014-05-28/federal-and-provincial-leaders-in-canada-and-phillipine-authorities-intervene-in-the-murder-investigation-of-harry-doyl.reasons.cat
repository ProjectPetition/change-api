The murder took place at Palma Beach Resort, in the southern most region of the Philippines on the island of Mindanao - Punta Bilar, Surigao City. Mr. Doyle was shot numerous times in front of 30 witnesses, and bled to death at the scene; and,\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, from the time of death the body was quickly embalmed and placed on display two days following the murder, with pictures of the deceased uploaded on Facebook.  Few facts and contradicting information were being released, which added to the grief and shock of Harry Doyle\u2019s violent murder; and, \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, on August 24th, a memorial service was held for Harry Doyle at St. Dunstan\u2019s Church in Fredericton, NB and attended by between 200-300 people. Much to the dismay of those in attendance, Harry\u2019s ashes, which were being returned to Canada by Harry\u2019s wife, Jane, were absent from the service, along with Harry\u2019s wife. It is our understanding that Jane Doyle arrived in Fredericton the following day, and media reports detailed her lack of collaboration and communication with immediate family members, and her failure to give specific details surrounding Harry\u2019s horrendous murder. Just a few days later, the Philippine Police alleged Jane Doyle to be a suspect, and were shocked to find out Jane had come to Canada with her son and, at the time, she was approximately six and a half months pregnant; and,\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/09/05/nb-philippines-charges-doyle-123.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/09/05/nb-philippines-charges-doyle-123.html</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, Jane Doyle did arrive in Canada in time for the reading of Harry Doyle\u2019s will, which son Stephen Doyle, who was never contacted by Jane Doyle, indicates is worth approximately 1.6 million dollars.\r\n\r\nGlobal News contacted Philippine National Police spokesperson Martin Gamba to confirm the latest details in the investigation. Gamba said investigators believe Jane was having \"an illicit relationship\" with Devocion, who was employed as Doyle\u2019s' driver and bodyguard.\"The two other suspects were the ones hired to do the job\", Gamba said in a telephone interview.\"That's the subject of the investigation\", he said. Although The Fredericton Daily Gleaner reported Filipino police were aware Jane Doyle is now in Canada, Gamba was surprised to learn of her whereabouts. \"We believed that she was still in the Philippines because right after the incident the investigators are following her and she will not be allowed to leave the country because of that case\" he said. (Nick Logan,GlobalNews:Wednesday,September05,2012,5:02PM) <a href=\"http://www.globalnews.ca/pages/story.aspx?id=6442709169\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.globalnews.ca/pages/story.aspx?id=6442709169</a>\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, Jane Doyle, who has remained in Fredericton at a friend\u2019s home, did deliver a son in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada in late November and, more recently, was awarded a substantial amount of money from Harry Doyle\u2019s estate through the Provincial Court in Fredericton, New Brunswick; and,\r\nWHEREAS, Jane Doyle, and her two sons, Joseph and the baby are still in Fredericton, since August 2012, and staying at the home of her friends, whose address is public knowledge; and,\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, Jane Doyle has, up to present, refused to return to the Philippines to face allegations of being part of the plan to murder her deceased husband with the motive reported as being money, and she has refused to cooperate with Philippine investigators in regards to the murder case of her Canadian husband; and, \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, Jane Doyle alleged that she and Harry had decided to have another child through artificial insemination.  Jane Doyle has reportedly refused to submit the newborn child\u2019s sample for DNA testing, and has reportedly not offered to show any documentation or receipts from the Philippine clinic, which she claims performed an artificial insemination.  Harry Doyle was bigger than life and would, in our opinion, make sure everyone knew about a new baby in the Doyle household; and, \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, Jane Doyle\u2019s newborn is believed to be, in fact, fathered by Jerome Devocion by the PNP investigators; that if, in fact, the child is not Harry Doyle's and is Jerome's; and they, in fact, conspired to have Harry Doyle killed - the child of two Filipino alleged murder suspects of a Canadian citizen, Harry Doyle, it appears will not only receive full Canadian citizenship, along with equal share in Harry's estate with his two other spouses, unless the issue is legally resolved; and, \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, in January 2013, Jane-Erma Undang Doyle was awarded a substantial amount of money from Harry Doyle\u2019s investment funds, in a Fredericton Court House; and,\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREAS,  a newly submitted Will from 2010,which apparently has only Harry Doyle\u2019s type- written signature removing Harry's two sons and leaving Jane 100% control of his estate and the sole beneficiary, is presently in the early stages of being legally contested;\r\n\r\nTHEREFORE, we petitioners call upon the Federal Government of Canada, and the New Brunswick Provincial Government for an independent, far-reaching and transparent judicial intervention, which would include having Jane Undung Doyle extradited from Fredericton, NB. and returned to face alleged charges for the murder of her husband Harry Doyle, and/or under Police watch until such time as this happens. \r\n\r\n1.\tProvide immediate interventions and demand that any and all money in Harry Doyle\u2019s last will and testimony and/ or other assets be frozen immediately until the trial and justice is served for Harry Doyle\u2019s murder in Suriago.\r\n\r\n2.\tTo have Erma Undang  (Jane) Doyle taken into custody to be extradited from Canada, and to work with Policing agencies from the Philippines, and ensure that an immediate DNA sample of Jane Doyle\u2019s baby boy born in Canada in Nov. 2012 is provided to the Philippine Authorities. Jane is believed by PNP investigators to be a primary suspect in her deceased husband, Harry Doyle\u2019s murder, which is believed to have been perpetrated to conceal the true identity of the father of the baby, and to gain control of his assets.\r\n\r\nAs a Government that has vowed to be tough on crime; the circumstances in regards to Harry Doyle\u2019s murder questions the dignity and integrity of Harry Doyle\u2019s life and death. Justice appears to have been delayed by the lack of action of the Canadian and New Brunswick Government. It appears the good nature, compassion, and generosity of the Canadian people, and the nation of Canada has been taken advantage of by Jane Doyle.
