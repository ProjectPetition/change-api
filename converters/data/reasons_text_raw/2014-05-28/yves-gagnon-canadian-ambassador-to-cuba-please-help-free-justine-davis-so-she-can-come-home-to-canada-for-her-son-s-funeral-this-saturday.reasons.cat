It is bad enough that she has to deal with the grief an loss of her son and I imagine she feels guilty due to the fact that she was driver when the accident happened, but let the woman get some closure and bury her son in peace. Then can she deal with the investigation afterwards. Horrible. Now my question is if Cuba treats all car accidents as a crime and are investigated why was the body of her son sent back home to Toronto if the investigation still on going? would the body not be evidence in the trial? also why would a mother, if she was planning on hurting/killing her son why would she do it by purposefully getting into a car accident in which she could have taken her own life as well. Anyway just my thoughts. Release Justine Davis so that she can say good-bye to her baby boy as I am sure she is heartbroken her is gone but will be even more heartbroken and depressed and may try to take her own life if she is unable to attend the funeral. No mother should have to bury their child, but no mother should be half way across the world while their family buries her child.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Sydney-Anne Nadjiwon","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/78800468"},{"created_at":"2014-02-07T02:26:15Z","content":"She deserves to say goodbye to her son.

I am tired of people continuing to travel to Cuba, only to get into some sort of terrible accident, or complication of some sort which enables the Cuban government to detain those people in Cuba for as long as they feel like keeping them there.  Now I know that many of you will think that I am kicking someone when they are down, that is not the case.  I, of course want Justine to come home.  I feel for her, she is the victim here, I am not blaming her, but when are people going to realize that Cuba is a communist country.  It is run by dictators who deny rights to their own citizens and if you are a visitor, you are completely at their mercy. People should be very afraid to travel to Cuba.  There have been many incidents of vacationers who have been involved in accidents, and have been detained until their case has been heard in court, or until hospital and other fees have been paid.  Nineteen year old Cody LeCompte was detained for over 4 months after he was broadsided by a truck, and faced up to three years in jail.  This is no more than blackmail, and historically, the Canadian government is powerless to help.  We, in Canada have no leverage to force Cuba to release anyone.  Unless the Canadian government boycotts travel to Cuba, which would impact their economy negatively, we have nothing to bargain with.  I hope and pray that the Canadian Ambassador can do something.

I agree that our embassies abroad are not doing what they should to protect and advocate for Canadian citizens who encounter issues abroad. Obviously this case is a terrible and traumatic one, but these types of things happen every day. My son, Alex Eby was detained at Customs at Gatwick Airport in England on December 31st. He was flying to visit his friends. His best friend lives in London, and Alex has visited many times. Both Alex and his friend are training/pursuing careers in soccer/football. The Customs Officer detained him. Locked him up, and he was questioned for about 12 hours.\r\nHis luggage was searched multiple times, and even though he told the complete and absolute truth, they told him that they did not believe him, and that he was being deported. He was held in jail, strip searched and kept with criminals for 3 and a half days while he waited for the next available flight from his carrier at that airport. His passport was seized until he reached Canadian soil. Foreign Affairs Emergency was useless and uninformed. They gave me a number that was never answered and from which calls were never returned. If I had not found an alternate number online I would never have reached my son. I called them back and told them all the misinformation they had given me : phone number, not a jail, no criminals, open access to phone calls and the internet, the ability to have and use his belongings etc. etc. Luckily, there was an end to his issues after a few days. I cannot imagine your family's pain....The Canadian Embassy in London NEVER got around to speaking to my son, even though they had assured me they would, and I had given them his number....just appalling!!!!

The Cuban government should not be allowing this type of treatment of visitors to their Island.  Even if the doctors don't think that Justine is in any condition to travel, they should give up that responsibility if a Medical Evacuation could be arranged through Justine's insurance company (if she had insurance).  Normally the reason for denial of release is lack of payment, but again I don't know what their reasoning is.  At this point it doesn't really matter, the CDN government should help to have her released from the hospital so that she could come back to attend her son's funeral.
