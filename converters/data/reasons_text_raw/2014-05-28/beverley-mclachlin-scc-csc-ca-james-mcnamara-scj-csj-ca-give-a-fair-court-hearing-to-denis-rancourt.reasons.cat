One is that the case is being financed by the University of Ottawa, with a promise to share the benefits if it is successful. I feel that as such it is being used as a SLAPP against Mr. Rancourt. This has serious implications for all dissenters and whistleblowers in Canada. In addition, I feel that the justices involved in this case have brought the legal profession into disrepute by their conduct in the courtroom (at times abusive and occasionally out of control, according to reports I have heard). The conflict of interest issue is an aspect of this. It seems odd that another judge, without ties, could not be found. Surely they must exist?
