This show promotes the negative Jewish stereotype known as \"JAP\" (Jewish American Princess), which a majority of Jewish women are not. I am disgusted that this is what people see when they think of a Jewish person. This is degrading and just plain appalling. I could never sit back and just watch a show promote my beautiful religion like this. ","like_count":0,"author_name":"Lauren Sharp","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/44454404"}]}
