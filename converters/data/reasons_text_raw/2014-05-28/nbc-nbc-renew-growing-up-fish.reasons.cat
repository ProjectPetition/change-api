Competition was stiff. I barely ever watched shows on other networks, CBS being the bottom of the list. Fast forward to 2014. I stopped watching NBC altogether because everything basically sucked. The only show that had any potential was Law & Order - and eventually, you cut that, too. Now, most of the shows I watch are on CBS. \n\nThere are two shows this season that brought me back to NBC - The Blacklist and Growing Up Fisher. The former, you guys are keeping. But I can't believe that you're cutting one of the best sitcoms in this day and age. My best friend is blind with a guide dog and everything about that is relevant. So are the characters and their struggles. The acting is hands down amazing, especially by JK Simmons and Eli Baker. You're taking away a great family drama that both children and adults can watch, a drama that sheds an incredible light on the visually impared community.\n\nNBC, this decision may be one of your worst decisions ever. Most of your shows are lame or seem like a desperate attempt to follow other networks. This felt real for the first time in a long time, and you're killing it?\n\nReevaluate your decision. Keep this show. And show some integrity by having and supporting good, clean sitcoms like Growing Up Fisher.

If this show was given the time slot that ABout A boy was it would be doing better... but instead you put that garbage up first.  Some perve guy befriending the boy next door and taking him to parties?  Seriously?  Growing up fisher on the other hand is about deying the odds, overcoming disabilities and making them into unique abilities.  It's about kids, and innocence and learning lessons in life.  It's appalling to me that you'd chose to pull a show so well written and full of heart.  If you do so, I wonder why your only motive in broadcasting is pure greed.  Shows are supposed to be about the art, the writing, the heart, and family.
