In addition to being stabbed multiple times, suffocated, strangled, or shot to death, many of the lesbians and toms had also been raped. In two cases of double homicides, lesbian couples were killed by men who objected to their relationship and felt rebuffed when their attempts at coercing one partner into a heterosexual relationship failed.\r\n\r\n24-year-old Nurisan Chedurame was described as a tomboy by those who knew her and in the media. Last December, she was found dead near her village\u2019s garbage dump with her head smashed in. A three-inch club was found at the crime scene. Relatives said that Nurisan had not returned from being out with friends the night before. Thai media quote police as suspecting she was killed because \u201cshe was involved with women.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlso in December, the body of 25-year-old tomboy Kanchana Changkwian was found two months after she went missing. In that case, police speculated that she had been raped and murdered \u201cfor becoming involved with a married woman.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn another case from last year a \u2018tom\u2019 (who is not named in reports) was murdered by her girlfriend\u2019s ex-boyfriend. Parents and relatives of the girlfriend (also not named) had opposed the relationship, and despite threats against the tom, had failed to stop the couple from continuing to see each other. The mother of the girlfriend engineered the murder of the tom and promised to marry off her daughter to the ex-boyfriend who committed the murder.\r\n\r\nMost of the verified cases have not been properly investigated because of a failure to recognize possible hate crime motives.\r\n\r\nSaid Grace Poore, of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC):\r\n\r\n\u201cThe killing and rapes of lesbians and toms represents a callous disregard for humanity. The failure of the Thai government to prevent or properly investigate these killings are not only appalling, they are evidence of poor governance and blatant violation of international human rights law.\u201d\r\n\r\nIGLHRC and Human Rights Watch (HRW) have written to the Thai government demanding that this pattern of killings be investigated. The letter also makes a series of recommendations that authorities work with local human rights groups to ensure that LGBT people enjoy the protections they have under Thai law and that they educate both law enforcement and the Thai public about those protections.\r\n\r\nThailand has signed a number of international treaties that guarantee respect for human rights, and it was one of the countries which supported the process at the United Nations, led by South Africa, which has resulted in the High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 report.\r\n\r\nAustralian police have released a shocking X-ray photo showing the skull of a murdered Chinese immigrant shot 34 times in the head and neck with a high-power nail gun.\r\n\r\nThe body of gay Chen Liu, 27, was found 2008 by two children  in marshland in south Sydney, wrapped in a carpet and bound with electrical wire.Detectives said the weapon used was a standard gas nail gun widely available and used in construction, firing nails up to 85mm (3.3 inches) long.\r\n\u201cIn 36 years, I\u2019ve never seen a murder of this nature,\u201d Homicide Squad Superintendent Geoff Beresford said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a particularly brutal and vicious murder and hence the reason we are seeking information from the public.\u201d\r\n\r\nLiu arrived in Australia in 2000 and was reported missing last year.\r\n\r\nPolice appealed to the public for help in solving the gruesome killing of a Chinese man who was shot 34 times in the head and neck with a nail gun before being dumped in a river.\r\n\r\nPolice have yet to say whether they\u2019ve identified any suspects.\r\n\r\nThe 34 nails were found during a post-mortem examination of Liu\u2019s body, and were located mainly in his skull. They were fired from an 85 mm nail gun at close range, Beresford said. Police have not recovered the weapon.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe certainly believe the nail gun is responsible for the death \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nPolice believe he was killed 12 days before his corpse was discovered.\r\n\r\nPolice are investigating associates of Liu, who also went by the name Anthony Liu, but said they have no evidence to suggest he was linked to any criminal group. They refused to say whether they\u2019ve identified any suspects or persons of interest.\r\n\r\nLiu arrived in the city of Melbourne on a student visa from China in early 2000 and moved to Sydney, where he married for a short time and separated, police said. They declined to release any additional information about him, including whether any of his family members are living in Australia.\r\n\u201cIn 36 years, I\u2019ve never seen a murder of this nature,\u201d Homicide Squad Superintendent Geoff Beresford said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a particularly brutal and vicious murder and hence the reason we are seeking information from the public.\u201d\r\n\r\nLiu arrived in Australia in 2000 and was reported missing last year.\r\n\r\nPolice appealed to the public for help in solving the gruesome killing of a Chinese man who was shot 34 times in the head and neck with a nail gun before being dumped in a river.\r\n\r\nPolice have yet to say whether they\u2019ve identified any suspects.\r\n\r\nThe 34 nails were found during a post-mortem examination of Liu\u2019s body, and were located mainly in his skull.
