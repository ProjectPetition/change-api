WE got sent down the mental health route and even had him put into a facility. We asked doctors about PANDAS and IVIG and they did not believe back in 2006. Today my son is 23 year old, we paid for IVIG out of pocket which cost us over 19K and he did great, sadly because he went for 9 years without proper treatment our son needs more treatments every 3 to 6 months. We have failed all our appeals with insurance so he is stuck at home, he missed all 4 years of HS, all 4 years of college, can't work a job, does not qualify for SSI or SSDI because of the political and insurance mess. I guess they are fine just drugging our children and putting them in mental health facilities rather than treat the physical illness so they can get their education and live their life like all other children. Please take the time to review the information about PANDAS and IVIG and change the laws and force the insurance company to pay for IVIG because the cost is far less doing the treatment early vs. having to find a place to put our children once their parents pass away. Give them a future not have them sitting in our homes.
