Trough OMGPOP orginate a lot of friendships across the world with no importance of age nationality or social condition.I met here 13 aged teenager, who enjoyed playing the games and who instead\r\nof taking drugs or haning around on the street without life goal are learning here team spirit.I met here middle aged people and pesioners, people with different jobs and different ideology playing together.And OMGPOP connect them all.Is such a shame, not only for a company, but also for the whole society to throw such a place only because is not profitable anymore.I am very well aware of how economics work, but this is the wrong way. Zinga dont be a bad example for a company and do something to keep that site, because friendship, teamspirit and fairness arhieved trough the games here are invaluable and much worth to throw them for  bad quotes.If u can t manage to do your job right and ignore the needsof your customers, sell OMGPOP to another company, who better know how to manage the site, but dont just throw it away.

Even ur own site doesn't have what omgpop has. I think its a shame u couldn't have put the time into omgpop and gave us what should have gotten bigger, more games were sappose to come out... new items were sappose to be added to all the shops, u did nothing. what the hell happened u dropped the ball and didn't give omgpop the chance to be all it could be... u went for that all mighty dollar for mobil and all the time u really had something here at omgpop u just didn't care about the site. I know if u had given as much time to omgpop as u did to ur all mighty mobil games omgpop wouldn't be shutting down it would be making money for u. Now here is a Question that maybe someone can answer... Now that u have announced that omgpop will be shutting down why can't zynga incorporate omgpop game into there site omgpop has a much better set up than ur own zynga site incorporate them into zynga.

Zinga dont be a bad example for a company and do something \r\nto keep that site, because friendship, teamspirit and fairness arhieved trough the games here are invaluable\r\nand not worth to throw all this for a bad quotes.If u can t manage to do your job right and ignore the needs\r\nof your customers, then sell OMGPOP to another company, who better know how to manage the site, but dont just\r\nthrow it away.
