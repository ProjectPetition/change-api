I know that he has been waiting for that specific game, with anticipation. This is the only reason for me to fill out this petition, that you make it possible for people to download the games. That would be a great addition to those wonderful graphiccards.","like_count":1,"author_name":"Flemming Frederiksen","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/66296186"},{"created_at":"2013-10-24T16:43:03Z","content":"Not long after I bought my GTX770, Batman: Arkham Origins and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag became available as free games, I feel cheated >.&lt;","like_count":1,"author_name":"Kenny Lim","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/13221696"},{"created_at":"2013-10-25T01:28:33Z","content":"I recently ordered a GTX 760.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Aditya Bawankule","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/66520182"},{"created_at":"2013-10-23T07:05:07Z","content":"I bought gtx 770 at summer.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Taleiko Miroslav","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/66299528"},{"created_at":"2013-10-22T19:58:14Z","content":"I literally just bought a 770 a week ago, this sucks.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Cole Daubney","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/56028885"},{"created_at":"2013-10-24T19:50:13Z","content":"I just bought a 770 GTX a few days ago, and then I saw this new deal.
