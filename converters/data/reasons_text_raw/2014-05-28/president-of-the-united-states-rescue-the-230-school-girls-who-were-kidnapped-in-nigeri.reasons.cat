All countries now have a Muslim rape culture and a culture Agitation against Christians. All countries are now confronted with FGM, honor killings, child marriages, forced marriages. Germany alone has information of the BKA of 42,000 violent Islamists, which were few of them in terrorist camps. The terrorists have often indigenous citizenship and the women of the family and the environment cover their backs. The women monitored nobody and that's the mistake. The terrorists infiltrate the country with their hate campaigns, often married local women to residence permits and get a good life. Just why do our governments tolerate what is so obvious. America has the data monitoring program so obviously installed because we Europeans are unable to search for peace and security in their own countries and because here terrorists allowed to move freely with its numerous sympathizers and at our expense, have a good life, that they answered at some point with terrorism of the worst kind, which can be bombings, attacks with chemical and biological weapons. Thats the thank you of them to us. This blindness of our governments must be stopped and these people belong in jail and they must also not taken in our countries, including the women who cover the misdeeds of these monsters and give them alibis.
