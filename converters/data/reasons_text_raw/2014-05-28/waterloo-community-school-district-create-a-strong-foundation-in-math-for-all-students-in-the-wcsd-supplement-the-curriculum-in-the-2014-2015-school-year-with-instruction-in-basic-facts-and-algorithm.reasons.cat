I know the children exhibit an understand of what is being taught. I know they are scoring well in the work they do. However, they are missing a fundamental mastery of basic skills. Memorizing the times tables is useful for the rest of their lives. Long division is necessary in everyday life. These are only a few of the skills our children are missing out on.

I believe effective teaching involves providing different students with different avenues to learning. We all learn in different ways and the key is to help students find the one that fits them best and allow them to thrive. Please don\u2019t kill children\u2019s enthusiasm with artificial curriculum.

It is that strong grasp and mastery of the basic fundamental skills (eg. algorithms, times tables, long divisions, vertical additions) of mathematics that equips children with the ability to understand and develop their own strategies to reconfigure equations, problem-solve and think critically. Mathematics, a discipline defined by precision, gaining efficiency and proficiency through emphasis, memory work, and repeated practice empowers our children to truly appreciate the beauty of numbers in everyday life.\"  The words of Dr. Nhung Tran-Davies mother and physician petitioning the governing authority of her children's school in Alberta province, Canada.

It takes as much time to \"figure out\" what 11 minus 4 is as it does to \"figure out\" how to multiply or divide large numbers.  Basic facts means just that--\"basic\" facts.  As for the algorithms--what adult spends time taking apart large numbers to add, subtract, multiply, or divide, and spend an inordinate amount of time doing so.  Just not efficient.","like_count":0,"author_name":"Debbie Miller","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/91963800"},{"created_at":"2014-04-16T22:17:50Z","content":"The current math curriculum does not teach our children basic math skills (long division and multiplication) that they need to perform in advanced math or in math we use on a daily basis.
