First, I must admit that this is a great place to stimulate the public's interest on issues faced by marine species in the wild. However, Seaworld does it all wrong. For example, Dolphins have a behavioral need to hunt in groups for their food, and they need to be able to swim in deep waters to avoid getting sunburnt.  Orcas need an awful lot of space to swim to avoid developing the flaccid fin syndrome. Also, seals and belugas tend to develop mental issues caused by the constant fear induced by the sound of their predators' echolocation calls in nearby basins. Finally, many marine mammals show signs of early deafness caused by their own echolocation calls, which reverb loudly in the concrete pools they swim in all day. No animal should live like that. No marine mammals should end up in a place like SeaWorld. No respected band should endorse practices like those we can observe at Seaworld.","like_count":1,"author_name":"Melanie Drouin","author_url":"http://api.change.org/u/28162038"},{"created_at":"2013-11-27T18:31:19Z","content":"Hey Guys...

Orcas for example are highly intelligent and socially complex mammals who live in large family pods with bonds arguably stronger than it's human counterparts. They are magnificent wild animals that deserve their freedom in the ocean and not to be confined to a concrete box where they face unreasonable hardships for their life's entirety, until the day they die. \r\n\r\nWe believe BNL's intrinsic values are not aligned with a corporation like Seaworld or Marineland, and we have always appreciated BNL's thoughtful and progressive philosophies as both a group and individuals. \r\n\r\nWe encourage you to uphold these values in return for our utmost respect and continued devotion as one of Canada's most treasured exports. \r\n\r\nPeace & Love \r\n\r\nYour Fans\r\nSincerely, \r\nPeggy-Sue E.
