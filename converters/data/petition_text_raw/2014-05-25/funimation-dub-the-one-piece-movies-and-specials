{"petition_id":1333424,"title":"Funimation: Dub The One Piece Movies and Specials","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/funimation-dub-the-one-piece-movies-and-specials","overview":"<p><strong>ATTENTION ONE PIECE FANS!</strong></p>\r\n<p>Have you ever wished Funimation, who has done a great job of dubbing and releasing One Piece in North America, would get ahold of the rights to the movies and specials of One Piece, so that we can legally stream and buy subbed and dubbed versions of these? Well then support this petition!</p>\r\n<p>It is very hard to find some of the One Piece specials, as well as some of the movies. As Funimation has dubbed the anime and two of the movies already, and done it very well, it would make sense to allow these other One Piece movies and specials to be legally available in North America, and be in English. These movies include, One Piece the Movie, Adventure on Clockword Island, Chopper's Kingdom on the Island of the Strange Animals, Dead End Adventure, The Cursed Holy Sword, Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island, The Giant Mechanical Soldier of Karakuri Castle, Episode of Chopper Plus: Bloom in Winter Miracle Sakura, and One Piece Film Z. The specials include, Adventure in the Ocean's Navel, Once Upon the Great Sea! A Father's Huge HUGE Dream!, Protect! The Last Great Performance, The Detective Memoirs of Chief Straw Hat Luffy, Episode of Nami: Tears of a Navigator and the bonds of Friends, Episode of Luffy: Adventure on Hand Island, Episode of Merry: The Tale of One More Friend, and Glorious Island. All of these, while they will take time, money, and talent to dub and released, would not be hard to obtain the righs to. This would give fans the ability to legally purchase and watch these great additions to the world of One Piece. It would also give Funimation several areas for profit. I for one, know I'd buy the One Piece movies and specials. They licensed all the Dragon Ball movies and released them in collections, and seeing as how they've dubbed Episode of Alabasta and Strong World, it doesn't seem like it would be a much different case. Yet another positive for both Funimation, and the actual One Piece Studio, Toei Animation, is that it would cut down pirating, which is what many here in North America feel forced to do. We would love to buy and stream these specials and movies, if only we had the option! Still I would like to rally support for this cause! One Piece fans, spread this petition through forums, help us to be heard by Funimation!</p>","targets":[{"name":"Funimation Productions","type":"custom"}],"letter_body":"You have done a great job of dubbing the One Piece anime, and two of the movies.

Many fans would love the opportunity to legally buy and stream these excellent additions to the world of One Piece. It would also curb pirating, which is what many fans of One Piece feel the need to resort to, which hurts Toei Animation as well as you. You have done a great job so far of dubbing the anime with great voice actors, and keeping everything intact. You are the company we'd want to see officially releasing these movies and specials. Please consider this petition.","signature_count":21,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/6/xi/rx/XlXirXqgbTLWMtH-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":1000,"created_at":"2013-10-18T05:51:04Z","end_at":"2014-10-18T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Wyatt Mund","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/65843567","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
