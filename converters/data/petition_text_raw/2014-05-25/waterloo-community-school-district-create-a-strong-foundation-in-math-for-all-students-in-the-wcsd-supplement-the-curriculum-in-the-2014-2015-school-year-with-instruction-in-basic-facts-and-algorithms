Supplement the curriculum in the 2014-2015 school year with instruction in basic facts and algorithms.","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/waterloo-community-school-district-create-a-strong-foundation-in-math-for-all-students-in-the-wcsd-supplement-the-curriculum-in-the-2014-2015-school-year-with-instruction-in-basic-facts-and-algorithms","overview":"<p>We believe our children are being used in an educational experiment that many experts in the field of mathematics believe has already failed.</p>\r\n<p>Our children are falling behind their peers who are in classrooms with direct instruction, quality curriculum and teacher choice.</p>\r\n<p>Constructionist learning does not give a solid foundation in math to succed in high school and qualify a student for a STEM major in college.</p>\r\n<p>There is no edict in the Common Core Standards that requires any method of teaching or any specific curriculum. Teaching and practicing basic math facts in no way precludes problem solving. Rather it encourages students to go further and gives them the confidence to solve problems.</p>\r\n<p>Learning without mastery as the goal is meaningless. Spiraling through mathematical topics confuses children and leaves them with an incomplete foundation in mathematics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to what we see happening to our own children's education we have done the research. Investigations TERC and CME are at the bottom of the list for current math curriculum being sold in the US. We as taxpayers and parents feel Waterloo deserves the best.</p>","targets":[{"name":"Waterloo Community School District, Board President","title":"Board President","type":"custom"},{"name":"Jane Lindaman, Superintendent of schools","title":"Superintendent of schools","type":"custom"}],"letter_body":"Create a strong foundation in math for all students in the WCSD.
