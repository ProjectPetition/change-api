They want to blast away entire hills to get to it, leaving behind permanent scars on our lands that will never fully heal. This mining can also cause air and water pollution, and it&rsquo;s a threat to communities&rsquo; quality of life. That&rsquo;s what our neighbors in Wisconsin are dealing with as frac sand mining has exploded in their state in recent years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When the plans for mining were first introduced in our state, Iowans organized and came together in protest, persuading two counties to enact moratoria on frac sand mining &ndash; but they&rsquo;re only temporary and will expire this year if we don&rsquo;t take action. To protect Iowa&rsquo;s lands for good, we need a moratorium across Iowa.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re gathering signatures across the state RIGHT NOW to send to Governor Branstad and the state legislature telling them to protect Iowa&rsquo;s beautiful natural lands by kicking out these mining companies.

This was an important first step in protecting our state\u2019s natural beauty, but these moratoria expire and they only cover a portion of our state.  \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m writing to urge you to support a full state-wide moratorium on frac sand mining in Iowa. \r\n\r\nThese lands are home to some of our state\u2019s most ecologically rich and diverse areas. They are our state\u2019s heritage. If the mining industry is allowed to exploit these areas, they will literally blast away entire hills and bluffs, leaving behind permanent scars that will lower land values and never truly heal. This mining can also cause air and water pollution, and it\u2019s a threat to our communities\u2019 quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe people of Northeastern Iowa don\u2019t want these mines, and neither do I. Support a state-wide moratorium and tell the frac sand mining industry they are not welcome here in Iowa!
