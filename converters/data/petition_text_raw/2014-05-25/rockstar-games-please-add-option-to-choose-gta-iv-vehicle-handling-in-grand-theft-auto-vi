Some liked the new semi-simulation-style vehicle handling,&nbsp;while others hated it and preferred the classic arcade-style as&nbsp;seen in past GTA games. For some, this change ruined their experience with GTA IV.</p>\r\n<p>Now a similar&nbsp;situation is happening with the release of GTA V and it shows there's 2 main groups in your fanbase with very different preferences in vehicle handling, those who&nbsp;prefer&nbsp;semi-simulation-style handling and those who prefer arcade-style handling. Adding an option in the menu to change tne handling style would solve this&nbsp;problem and bring much joy to many of us who prefer semi-simulation-style handling.</p>\r\n<p>So please Rockstar Games, add an option to choose realistic handling in your future games.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank You</p>","targets":[],"letter_body":"Please add option to choose GTA IV vehicle handling in Grand Theft Auto VI.\r\n\r\nThank You.","signature_count":9,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/5/ud/da/IpUDDaabvBmlKyu-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":100,"created_at":"2013-09-24T00:21:30Z","end_at":"2014-09-24T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Michael Anderson","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/63556072","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
