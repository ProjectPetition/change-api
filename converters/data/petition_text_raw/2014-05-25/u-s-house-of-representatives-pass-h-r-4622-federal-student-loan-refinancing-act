The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports $902B while the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau reports $1T</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Congressmen Mark Pocan, D-Wis., and Scott Peters, D-Calif., along with 21 other House Democrats, have introduced legislation to lower all federal student loans to 4 percent and allow borrowers to refinance their student loans at a lower rate.</p>\r\n<p>Two-thirds of Americans now leave college weighed down by massive student loan debt, unable to achieve their dreams and contribute to the growth of the economy,&rdquo; Pocan said in a statement. &ldquo;Our bill will allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their student loans, just like you can refinance a house or car loan, freeing up funds to buy a house, get a new car, support a family, and pursue greater economic opportunities. Congress should be doing all that it can to make a college education as affordable and accessible as possible. While there are many steps that need to be taken in order to increase college affordability, this bill addresses an issue that will help 90 percent of consumers with existing student loan debt. This important legislation will respond to the immediate need for relief from the student loan crisis.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many countries offer programs to make education less expensive and help pay for school, the United States of America is making&nbsp;<strong>billions</strong> of dollars off of the interest &nbsp;on our student's loans. &nbsp;This isn't a conspiracy or some opressive program, it's just a result of congress being slow to act on lowering interest rates after rates fell in 2009.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you are a student this bill will help you.</p>\r\n<p>If you have kids that have student loans or will in the near future this bill will help you.</p>\r\n<p>If you live in the United States and care about the future of America this bill will help you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank You,</p>\r\n<p>-Joshua Isaac White</p>","targets":[{"name":"U.S. House of Representatives","type":"us_government"},{"name":"U.S. Senate","type":"us_government"}],"letter_body":"Pass H.R. 4622 Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act","signature_count":29,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/fh/xe/eaFhxeiiCFkmisN-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":100,"created_at":"2014-05-13T15:17:46Z","end_at":"2015-05-13T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Joshua White","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/13051618","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
