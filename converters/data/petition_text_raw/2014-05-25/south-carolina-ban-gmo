{"petition_id":1323950,"title":"South Carolina: Ban GMO","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/south-carolina-ban-gmo","overview":"<p>I am asking South Carolina, as a start of hopefully something bigger and better, to ban GMO. The reason for this is because there has been many scientific reports leading to the conclusion that GMO is a dangerous procedure leading to plants that spread, along with their ownselves, uncanny genetic results that cause humans to procure many physical and emotional aliments, such as ADD, arthiritis and even cancer. If you care any bit about yourself and others health then I plead you to sign this petition to remove and ban all GMO plants and products from South Carolina.</p>","targets":[{"name":"Jeff Duncan, SC House of Representatives","title":"SC House of Representatives","type":"custom"},{"name":"U.S. House of Representatives","type":"us_government"},{"name":"Rep.
