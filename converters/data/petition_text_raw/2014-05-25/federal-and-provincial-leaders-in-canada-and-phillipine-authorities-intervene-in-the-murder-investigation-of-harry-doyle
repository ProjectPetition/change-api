His wife Jane was charged and the arrest warrant was issued in Aug. 2013. Jane fled to Canada very shortly after Harry was murdered. Jane knew she was being questioned and perhaps considered a suspect when she fled. At the time she fled Jane was pregnant, with what Police are saying, with the baby of Harry's bodyguard.
