These PEOPLE that we elect make descions that affect our lives everyday and most them have no idea what we go through. They simply can not relate on a personal level.

No &nbsp;Tenure / No Pension.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Congressman/woman collects a salary while in office and receives no</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay when they're out of office.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. &nbsp;Congress (past, present &amp; future) participates in Social</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American people. It may not be used for any other purpose.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, &nbsp;just as all</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans do.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Congress loses their current health care system and</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participates in the same health care system as the American people.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American people.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen/women are void</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effective 1/1/12. The American people did not make this</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contract with Congressmen/women.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congressmen/women made all these contracts for themselves. Serving in</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;term(s), then go home and back to work.</span></p>","targets":[{"name":"President of the United States","type":"us_government"},{"name":"U.S. Senate","type":"us_government"},{"name":"U.S. House of Representatives","type":"us_government"}],"letter_body":"Pass Congressional Reform","signature_count":42,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/9/ti/nr/fMTinryaHQrFnJF-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":100,"created_at":"2013-11-19T17:47:48Z","end_at":"2014-11-19T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Doran Whisman","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/38297491","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
