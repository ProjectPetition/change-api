{"petition_id":1340239,"title":"Raymond Jr / Sr High School: Hire an actual foreign language teacher and refrain from using an online program.","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/raymond-jr-sr-high-school-hire-an-actual-foreign-language-teacher-and-refrain-from-using-an-online-program","overview":"<p>At my school in Raymond, Washington, we are taught foreign language by means of an online program known as \"Apex Learning\". However, many students agree that a human being should be teaching the class. For me at least, learning a foreign language on a program has proven itself to be quite difficult. Machines can never replace human beings as teachers. Since this is an online program, students have a better chance of cheating and getting away with it than they would if there was a human teaching the class. If a student is having a hard time understanding a subject, a teacher may better explain to the student what they are not understanding. With a program, you're stuck with what you get. Please sign my petition so that we (the students) may have a higher value of foreign language education.</p>","targets":[],"letter_body":"Thank you very much for helping me reach one step further into getting a foreign language teacher for my school. It really means a lot that you are helping the students and I. If there is something you'd like me to aide you in, don't hesitate to tell me what it is.","signature_count":75,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/ul/nm/lAULNMqGmgrcqbk-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":100,"created_at":"2013-10-26T21:07:57Z","end_at":"2014-10-26T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Christopher Gundersen","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/62537010","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
