{"petition_id":1159190,"title":"United Nations: Stop the rise of homophobia in Russia","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/united-nations-stop-the-rise-of-homophobia-in-russia","overview":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We, the residents of Toronto, Ontario draw the attention of the United Nations to the issue of allowing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) rights in Russia. Russia has outlawed gay &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; to minors meaning that homosexual minors cannot present themselves to the public as homosexuals. This would be considered illegal and many of whom would be fined thousands of dollars if public support was shown for the LGTB community (Birnbaum).</p>\r\n<p>Homophobia is on the rise, as many heterosexuals are discriminating against the LGBT community and many of these cases are leading to motivated crimes (Heiss). Many of these hate motive crimes are not even recognized or investigated by the police or even the community of where the person resides. This is a major issue because often the police fail to investigate hate motive crimes, even when they know they should be doing their job and reporting these crimes to the police force.</p>\r\n<p>By signing this petition, petitioners will request that the United Nations support the withdrawal of the law that ban people from supporting gay &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; in Russia and to ensure that police investigate hate crimes against the LGBT community and are dealt with by law. This would allow fellow humans to be free to be who they are.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your support,</p>\r\n<p>Carina and Sameer</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Works Cited</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Heiss, Jasmine. \"As the World Celebrates IDAHO, Homophobia in Russia is on the Rise.\"&nbsp;<em>Human Rights Now</em>.

We are writing to you in regards to the recent rise of homophobia in Russia. We believe that as Canadians, whose country has a reputation as a peacekeeper, we must try to help the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community in Russia. We have conducted thorough research and have read various articles on this issue. \r\n\r\n     We believe that everyone should be treated equally whether one is heterosexual or not. In Russia, a law was passed banning the exposure of gay propaganda to minors. If minors are not informed that there is no issue in being gay, then they will be forced into a life they do not want. One should not discriminate against another based on sexual orientation or preference. This law is extremely offensive towards the LGBT community in Russia. There is no problem whether one is a homosexual or not.\r\n\r\n     Since homophobia in Russia is on the rise, we would like you to bring up this topic at the next United Nations meeting you attend. As youth, we do not have as much power and influence as yourself, so we would like you to pass on our message.\r\n\r\n     We thank you for taking the time to read our letter. We look forward to hearing back from you. Thank you for your consideration.
