The Commission is controlled by the Democratic and Republican parties who supposedly have our best interests at heart. The Commission is headed by Frank Fahrenkopf, a former head of the Republican National Committee, and former White House press secretary Michael D. McCurry. As of 2011, the Board of directors consists of Howard Graham Buffett, John C. Danforth, John Griffen, Antonia Hernandez, Caroline Kennedy, Newton N. Minow, Richard D. Parsons, Dorothy Ridings, and Alan K. Simpson. The Presidential debates are controlled by the Democratic and Republican parties.</p>\r\n<p>We live in a country where deep polarizing issues are crippling the United States. The United States needs change. Whether this change will come from a member of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, the Constitution Party, or any of the other various political parties within the United States, cannot be known at the present time. But, what we all can know is that information is being deliberately kept from people. Many people do not even know that the Libertarian Party (currently the third largest political party in the United States) exists. For those that do know of it's existence, many could not say who Gary Johnson (the Libertarian candidate) is or what the Libertarian Party stands for. The same goes for the Green Party, the Constitution Party and any of the smaller political parties.</p>\r\n<p>The Commission on Presidential Debates is controlled by the Republican and Democratic parties. If they truly cared about the United States of America, they would let third parties participate in the presidential debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates has the authority to change the necessary requirements to be a part of the debate. The United States of America has many social, economic, domestic and foreign issues. How can the Democratic and Republican parties be so rash and say that these third parties could not be the solution? They cannot know. If a candidate can get onto the ballot of a majority of the present 50 states they must be allowed to participate in the presidential debates. The people of the United States should be informed about all of the decisions open to them. Not just two.</p>","targets":[{"name":"Janet H.
