In Canada, they had passed in their \"Radio Act\" to ban any fake news report. Now, we need to do the same thing too by shuting down any fake news report that gets us to the point that we get angry at the GOP. We need to use our voice to tell the Federal Government to bring in that act to stop Fox News for once.</p>","targets":[{"name":"U.S. House of Representatives","type":"us_government"},{"name":"U.S. Senate","type":"us_government"}],"letter_body":"Bring In the Radio Act","signature_count":8,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/0/mj/ev/HbmJEVmOWnwdasl-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":100,"created_at":"2014-04-29T16:02:04Z","end_at":"2015-04-29T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Jeff Shurling","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/87093433","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
