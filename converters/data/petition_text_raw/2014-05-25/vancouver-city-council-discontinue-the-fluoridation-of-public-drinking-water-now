Fluoridation is an outdated form of mass medication.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike all other water treatment processes,<br /> fluoridation does not treat the water itself, but<br /> the person consuming it. The Food &amp; Drug Administration<br /> accepts that fluoride is a drug, not<br /> a nutrient, when used to prevent disease. By<br /> definition, therefore, fluoridating water is a form<br /> of mass medication. This is why most western<br /> European nations have rejected the practice&mdash;<br /> because, in their view, the public water supply<br /> is not an appropriate place to be adding drugs,<br /> particularly when fluoride is readily available for<br /> individual use in the form of toothpaste.</p>\r\n<p>2. Fluoridation is unnecessary and ineffedtive.</p>\r\n<p>The most obvious reason to end fluoridation is<br /> that it is now known that fluoride&rsquo;s main benefit<br /> comes from topical contact with the teeth, not<br /> from ingestion. Even the CDC&rsquo;s Oral Health Division<br /> now acknowledges this. There is simply no<br /> need, therefore, to swallow fluoride, whether in<br /> the water, toothpaste, or any other form. Further,<br /> despite early claims that fluoridated water would<br /> reduce cavities by 65%, modern large-scale<br /> studies show no consistent or meaningful difference<br /> in the cavity rates of fluoridated and nonfluoridated<br /> areas.</p>\r\n<p>3. Fluoridation is <strong>not safe.</strong></p>\r\n<p>First, there is no dispute that fluoridation is causing<br /> millions of children to develop dental fluorosis, a<br /> discoloration of the teeth that is caused by excessive<br /> fluoride intake. Scientists from the Centers<br /> for Disease Control have even acknowledged that<br /> fluoridation is causing &ldquo;cosmetically objectionable&rdquo;<br /> fluorosis on children&rsquo;s front teeth&ndash;an effect that<br /> can cause embarrassment and distress at a time<br /> of life when physical appearance is the single most<br /> important predictor of self-esteem.</p>\r\n<p>Second, it is known that fluoridated water caused<br /> severe bone disease in dialysis patients up until<br /> the late 1970s (prior to dialysis units filtering fluoride).<br /> While dialysis units now filter out the fluoride,<br /> research shows that current fluoride exposures<br /> are still resulting in dangerously high bone fluoride<br /> levels in dialysis patients and patients with other<br /> advanced forms of kidney disease. It is unethical<br /> to compromise the health of some members<br /> in a population to obtain a purported benefit for<br /> another &mdash; particularly in the absence of these<br /> vulnerable members&rsquo; knowing consent.</p>\r\n<p>And, finally, a growing body of evidence reasonably<br /> indicates that fluoridated water, in addition<br /> to other sources of daily fluoride exposure, can<br /> cause or contribute to a range of serious effects,<br /> including arthritis, damage to the developing brain,<br /> reduced thyroid function, and possibly osteosarcoma<br /> (bone cancer) in adolescent males.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;There is a plethora of studies that show a clear disconnect from the intentions of Fluoridation and the actual effects it has on the consumer. These studies also make it very clear there are serious adverse effects from the fluoridation of water. One Harvard University study showed that &ldquo;children in high fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low fluoridation areas.&rdquo; This is especially significant when you consider those who consume the highest concentration compared to body weight, infants.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Children are being over-exposed to fluoride.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The fluoridation program has massively failed to achieve one of its key objectives, i.e., to lower dental decay rates while limiting the occurrence of dental fluorosis (a discoloring of tooth enamel caused by too much fluoride. The goal of the early promoters of fluoridation was to limit dental fluorosis (in its very mild form) to10% of children (NRC 1993, pp. 6-7). In 2010, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 41% of American adolescents had dental fluorosis, with 8.6% having mild fluorosis and 3.6% having either moderate or severe dental fluorosis (Beltran-Aguilar2010). As the 41% prevalence figure is a national average and includes children living in fluoridated and unfluoridated areas, the fluorosis rate in fluoridated communities will obviously be higher. The British Government&rsquo;s York Review estimated that up to 48% of children in fluoridated areas worldwide have dental fluorosis in all forms, with 12.5% having fluorosis of aesthetic concern (McDonagh, 2000).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Highest doses of fluoride are going to bottle-fed babies.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">Because of their sole reliance on liquids for their food intake, infants consuming formula made with fluoridated water have the highest exposure to fluoride, by bodyweight, in the population. Because infant exposure to fluoridated water has been repeatedly found to be a major risk factor for developing dental fluorosis later in life (Marshall 2004; Hong 2006; Levy 2010), a number of dental researchers have recommended that parents of newborns not use fluoridated water when reconstituting formula (Ekstrand 1996; Pendrys 1998; Fomon 2000; Brothwell 2003; Marshall 2004). Even the American Dental Association (ADA), the most ardent institutional proponent of fluoridation, distributed a November 6, 2006 email alert to its members recommending that parents be advised that formula should be made with &ldquo;low or no-fluoride water.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the ADA has done little to get this information into the hands of parents. As a result, many parents remain unaware of the fluorosis risk from infant exposure to fluoridated water.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">FLUORIDE MAY DAMAGE THE BRAIN.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">According to the National Research Council (2006), &ldquo;it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain.&rdquo; In a review of the literature commissioned by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), fluoride has been listed among about 100 chemicals for which there is substantial evidence of developmental neurotoxicity.&rdquo; Animal experiments show that fluoride accumulates in the brain and alters mental behavior in a manner consistent with a neurotoxic agent (Mullenix 1995). In total, there have now been over 100 animal experiments showing that fluoride can damage the brain and impact learning and behavior. According to fluoridation proponents, these animal studies can be ignored because high doses were used. However, it is important to note that rats generally require five times more fluoride to reach the same plasma levels in humans (Sawan 2010). Further, one animal experiment found effects at remarkably low doses (Varner 1998). In this study, rats fed for one year with 1 ppm</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">fluoride in their water (the same level used in fluoridation programs), using either sodium fluoride or aluminum fluoride, had morphological changes to their kidneys and brains, an increased uptake of aluminum in the brain, and the formation of beta-amyloid deposits which are associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Other animal studies have found effects on the brain at water fluoride levels as low as 5 ppm (Liu 2010).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">FLUORIDE MAY LOWER IQ.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">There have now been 33 studies from China, Iran, India and Mexico that have reported an association between fluoride exposure and reduced IQ. One of these studies (Lin 1991) indicates that even just moderate levels of fluoride exposure (e.g., 0.9 ppm in the water) can exacerbate the neurological defects of iodine deficiency. Other studies have found IQ reductions at 1.9 ppm (Xiang 2003a,b); 0.3-3.0 ppm (Ding 2011); 1.8-3.9 ppm (Xu 1994); 2.0 ppm (Yao 1996, 1997); 2.1-3.2 ppm (An 1992); 2.38 ppm (Poureslami 2011); 2.45 ppm (Eswar 2011); 2.5 ppm (Seraj 2006); 2.85 ppm (Hong 2001); 2.97 ppm (Wang 2001, Yang 1994); 3.15 ppm (Lu 2000); 4.12 ppm (Zhao 1996). In the Ding study, each 1 ppm increase of fluoride in urine was associated with a loss of 0.59 IQ points. None of these studies indicate an adequate margin of safety to protect all children drinking artificially fluoridated water from this affect. According to the National Research Council (2006), &ldquo;the consistency of the results [in fluoride/IQ studies] appears significant enough to warrant additional research on the effects of fluoride on intelligence.&rdquo; The NRC&rsquo;s conclusion has recently been amplified by a team of Harvard scientists whose fluoride/IQ meta-review concludes that fluoride&rsquo;s impact on the developing brain should be a &ldquo;high research priority.&rdquo; (Choi et al., 2012). Except for two small IQ studies from New Zealand (Shannon et al., 1986; Spittle 1998) no fluoridating country has yet investigated the matter.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">FLUORIDE MAY CAUSE NON-IQ NEUROTOXIC EFFECTS.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">Reduced IQ is not the only neurotoxic effect that may result from fluoride exposure. At least three human studies have reported an association between fluoride exposure and impaired visual-spatial organization (Calderon 2000; Li 2004; Rocha-Amador 2009); while four other studies have found an association between prenatal fluoride exposure and fetal brain damage (Han 1989; Du 1992; Dong 1993; Yu 1996).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">FLUORIDE AFFECTS THE PINEAL GLAND.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">Studies by Jennifer Luke (2001) show that fluoride accumulates in the human pineal gland to very high levels. In her Ph.D. thesis, Luke has also shown in animal studies that fluoride reduces melatonin production and leads to an earlier onset of puberty (Luke 1997). Consistent with Luke&rsquo;s findings, one of the earliest fluoridation trials in the U.S. (Schlesinger 1956) reported that on average young girls in the fluoridated community reached menstruation 5 months earlier than girls in the non-fluoridated community. Inexplicably, no fluoridating country has attempted to reproduce either Luke&rsquo;s or Schlesinger&rsquo;s findings or examine the issue any further.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">FLUORIDE AFFECTS THYROID FUNCTION.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the U.S. National Research Council (2006), &ldquo;several lines of information indicate an effect of fluoride exposure on thyroid function.&rdquo; In the Ukraine, Bachinskii (1985) found a lowering of thyroid function, among otherwise healthy people, at 2.3 ppm fluoride in water. In the middle of the 20th century, fluoride was prescribed by a number of European doctors to reduce the activity of the thyroid gland for those suffering from hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Stecher 1960; Waldbott 1978). According to a clinical study by Galletti and Joyet (1958), the thyroid function of hyperthyroid patients was effectively reduced at just 2.3 to 4.5 mg/day of fluoride ion. To put this finding in perspective, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS, 1991) has estimated that total fluoride exposure in fluoridated communities ranges from 1.6 to 6.6 mg/day. This is a remarkable fact, particularly consider ing the rampant and increasing problem of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) in the United States and other fluoridated countries. Symptoms of hypothyroid ism include depression, fatigue, weight gain, muscle and joint pains, increased cholesterol levels, and heart disease. In 2010, the second most prescribed drug of the year was Synthroid (sodium levothyroxine) which is a hormone replacement drug used to treat an underactive thyroid.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">FLUORIDE CAUSES ARTHRITIC SYMPTOMS.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">Some of the early symptoms of skeletal fluorosis (a fluoride-induced bone and joint disease that impacts millions of people in India, China, and Africa), mimic the symptoms of arthritis (Singh 1963; Franke 1975; Teotia 1976; Carnow 1981; Czerwinski 1988; DHHS 1991). According to a review on fluoridation published in Chemical &amp; Engineering News, &ldquo;Because some of the clinical symptoms mimic arthritis, the first two clinical phases of skeletal fluorosis could be easily misdiagnosed&rdquo; (Hileman 1988). Few, if any, studies have been done to determine the extent of this misdiagnosis, and whether the high prevalence of arthritis in America (1 in 3 Americans have some form of arthritis &ndash; CDC, 2002) and other fluoridated countries is related to growing fluoride exposure, which is highly plausible. Even when individuals in the U.S. suffer advanced forms of skeletal fluorosis (from drinking large amounts of tea), it has taken years of misdiagnoses before doctors finally correctly diagnosed the condition as fluorosis.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">FLUORIDE DAMAGES BONE.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;An early fluoridation trial (Newburgh-Kingston 1945-55) found a significant two-fold increase in cortical bone defects among children in the fluoridated community (Schlesinger 1956). The cortical bone is the outside layer of the bone and is important to protect against fracture. While this result was not considered important at the time with respect to bone fractures, it did prompt questions about a possible link to osteosarcoma (Caffey, 1955; NAS, 1977). In 2001, Alarcon-Herrera and co-workers reported a linear correlation between the severity of dental fluorosis and the frequency of bone fractures in both children and adults in a high fluoride area in Mexico.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">FLUORIDE MAY INCREASE HIP FRACTURES IN THE ELDERLY.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;When high doses of fluoride (average 26 mg per day) were used in trials to treat patients with osteoporosis in an effort to harden their bones and reduce fracture rates, it actually led to a higher number of fractures, particularly hip fractures (Inkovaara 1975; Gerster 1983; Dambacher 1986; O&rsquo;Duffy 1986; Hedlund 1989; Bayley 1990; Gutteridge 1990. 2002; Orcel 1990; Riggs 1990 and Schnitzler 1990). Hip fracture is a very serious issue for the elderly, often leading to a loss of independence or a shortened life. There have been over a dozen studies published since 1990 that have investigated a possible relationship between hip fractures and long term consumption of artificially fluoridated water or water with high natural levels. The results have been mixed &ndash; some have found an association and others have not. Some have even claimed a protective effect. One very important study in China, which examined hip fractures in six Chinese villages, found what appears to be a dose-related increase in hip fracture as the concentration of fluoride rose from 1 ppm to 8 ppm (Li 2001) offering little comfort to those who drink a lot of fluoridated water. Moreover, in the only human epidemiological study to assess bone strength as a function of bone fluoride concentration, researchers from the University of Toronto found that (as with animal studies) the strength of bone declined with increasing fluoride content (Chachra 2010). Finally, a recent study from Iowa (Levy 2009), published data suggesting that low-level fluoride exposure may have a detrimental effect on cortical bone density in girls (an effect that has been repeatedly documented in clinical trials and which has been posited as an important mechanism by which fluoride may increase bone fracture rates).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRED KIDNEY FUNCTION ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO BONE DAMAGE.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;Because of their inability to effectively excrete fluoride, people with kidney disease are prone to accumulating high levels of fluoride in their bone and blood. As a result of this high fluoride body burden, kidney patients have an elevated risk for developing skeletal fluorosis. In one of the few U.S. studies investigating the matter, crippling skeletal fluorosis was documented among patients with severe kidney disease drinking water with just 1.7 ppm fluoride (Johnson 1979). Since severe skeletal fluorosis in kidney patients has been detected in small case studies, it is likely that larger, systematic studies would detect skeletal fluorosis at even lower fluoride levels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">FLUORIDE MAY CAUSE BONE CANCER (OSTEOSARCOMA).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">A U.S. government-funded animal study found a dose-dependent increase in bone cancer (osteosarcoma) in fluoride-treated, male rats (NTP 1990). Following the results of this study, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) reviewed national cancer data in the U.S. and found a significantly higher rate of osteosarcoma (a bone cancer) in young men in fluoridated versus unfluoridated areas (Hoover et al 1991a). While the NCI concluded (based on an analysis lacking statistical power) that fluoridation was not the cause (Hoover et al 1991b), no explanation was provided to explain the higher rates in the fluoridated areas. A smaller study from New Jersey (Cohn 1992) found osteosarcoma rates to be up to 6 times higher in young men living in fluoridated versus unfluoridated areas. Other epidemiological studiesof varying size and quality have failed to find this relationship (a summary of these can be found in Bassin, 2001 and Connett &amp; Neurath, 2005). There are three reasons why a fluoride-osteosarcoma connection is plausible: First, fluoride accumulates to a high level in bone. Second, fluoride stimulates bone growth. And, third, fluoride can interfere with the genetic apparatus of bone cells in several ways; it has been shown to be mutagenic, cause chromosome damage, and interfere with the enzymes involved with DNA repair in both cell and tissue studies (Tsutsui 1984; Caspary 1987; Kishi 1993; Mihashi 1996; Zhang 2009). In addition to cell and tissue studies, a correlation between fluoride exposure and chromosome damage in humans has also been reported (Sheth 1994; Wu 1995; Meng 1997; Joseph 2000).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">PROPONENTS HAVE FAILED TO REFUTE THE BASSIN-OSTEOSARCOMA STUDY.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2001, Elise Bassin, a dentist, successfully defended her doctoral thesis at Harvard in which she found that young boys had a five-to-seven fold increased risk of getting osteosarcoma by the age of 20 if they drank fluoridated water during their mid-childhood growth spurt (age 6 to 8). The study was published in 2006 (Bassin 2006) but has been largely discounted by fluoridating countries because her thesis adviser Professor Chester Douglass (a promoter of fluoridation and a consultant for Colgate) promised a larger study that he claimed would discount her thesis (Douglass and Joshipura, 2006). Now, after 5 years of waiting the Douglass study has finally been published (Kim 2011) but in no way does this study discount Bassin&rsquo;s findings. The study, which used far fewer controls than Bassin&rsquo;s analysis, did not even attempt to assess the age-specific window of risk that Bassin identified. Indeed, by the authors&rsquo; own admission, the study had no capacity to assess the risk of osteosarcoma among children and adolescents (the precise population of concern).

In addition, an epidemiological study from the US found increased rates of infertility among couples living in areas with 3 ppm or more fluoride in the water (Freni 1994), two studies have found increased fertility among men living in high-fluoride areas of China and India (Liu 1988; Neelam 1987); four studies have found reduced level of circulating testosterone in males living in high fluoride areas (Hao 2010; Chen P 1997; Susheela 1996; Barot 1998), and a study of fluoride-exposed workers reported a &ldquo;subclinical reproductive effect&rdquo; (Ortiz-Perez 2003). While animal studies by FDA researchers have failed to find evidence of reproductive toxicity in fluoride-exposed rats (Sprando 1996, 1997, 1998), the National Research Council (2006) has recommended that, &ldquo;the relationship between fluoride and fertility requires additional study.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO LOW LEVELS OF FLUORIDE AS SHOWN BY CASE STUDIES AND DOUBLE BLIND STUDIES.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In one study, which lasted 13 years, Feltman and Kosel (1961) showed that about 1% of patients given 1 mg of fluoride each day developed negative reactions. Many individuals have reported suffering from symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, rashes and stomach and gastro intestinal tract problems, which disappear when they avoid fluoride in their water and diet (Shea 1967; Waldbott 1978; Moolenburgh 1987). Frequently the symptoms reappear when they are unwittingly exposed to fluoride again (Spittle, 2008). No fluoridating government has conducted scientific studies to take this issue beyond these anecdotal reports. Without the willingness of governments to investigate these reports scientifically, should we as a society be forcing these people to ingest fluoride?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">OTHER SUBSETS OF POPULATION ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO FLUORIDE&rsquo;S TOXICITY.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pa0\">In addition to people suffering from impaired kidney function discussed previously other subsets of the population are more vulnerable to fluoride&rsquo;s toxic effects. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR 1993) these include: infants, the elderly, and those with diabetes mellitus. Also vulnerable are those who suffer from malnutrition (e.g., calcium, magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin D and iodine deficiencies and protein-poor diets) and those who have diabetes insipidus.
