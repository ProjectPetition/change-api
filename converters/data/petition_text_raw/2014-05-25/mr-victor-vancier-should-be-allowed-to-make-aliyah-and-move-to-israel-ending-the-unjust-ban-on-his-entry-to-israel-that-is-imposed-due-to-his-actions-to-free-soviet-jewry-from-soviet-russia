{"petition_id":1342269,"title":"Mr. Victor Vancier should be allowed to make aliyah and move to Israel, ending the unjust ban on his entry to Israel that is imposed due to his actions to free Soviet Jewry from Soviet Russia.","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/mr-victor-vancier-should-be-allowed-to-make-aliyah-and-move-to-israel-ending-the-unjust-ban-on-his-entry-to-israel-that-is-imposed-due-to-his-actions-to-free-soviet-jewry-from-soviet-russia","overview":"<p>The JDL fought long and hard to free Soviet Jews from the opressive Soviet regime with Rabbi Meir Kahane, and after having to engage in public disobediance and activities which damanged Soviet property (where no one was killed), they were finally scared into ending their policy of keeping Jews trapped in Russia, because their relations with the United States had deteroriated. Mr. Victor Vancier was the chairman of this organization. Those who fought to free Soviet Jews are heroes that stopped the opression in Soviet Russia, and had a huge role to play in the breakdown of US-Soviet relations, which ultimately lead to the collapse of communism in Russia. These heroes are being banned from entry to Israel, and Mr. Vancier in particular, even though they love the Jewish people and would never do anything to harm the great state of Israel. By signing this petition, you are ensuring not only that one man be allowed to return to his true home, but that every Jew in times of need can return in spite of what one or two ministers say, or even the enttire Israeli cabinet, because it is every Jew's right to live with their family in their land.</p>","targets":[],"letter_body":"Please sign the petition and publicize it in Israel to end this injustice.","signature_count":14,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/7/fx/ia/MnFXiadhbRPrDDd-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":100,"created_at":"2013-10-29T19:45:10Z","end_at":"2014-10-29T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"John Williamson","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/66922153","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
