We pay money to play games just like everyone else, if DLC does come to Wii U just like every other platform, guess what, more people will get the Wii U version. If no DLC ever comes to the Wii U, don't complain to us Wii U owners for not buying the game because we didn't want to buy a gimped version of a game.</p>","targets":[],"letter_body":"Announce DLC plans for COD: Ghost on Wii U.\n","signature_count":165,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/app-assets/petitions/show/default_petition-2dea4f8fdd8a3fa93201db8b1c7cf36d.png","category":null,"goal":200,"created_at":"2013-09-14T07:09:57Z","end_at":"2014-09-14T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Robert Feinburg","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/41253130","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
