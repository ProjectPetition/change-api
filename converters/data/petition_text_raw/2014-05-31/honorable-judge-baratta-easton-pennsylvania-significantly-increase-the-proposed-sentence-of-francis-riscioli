Regrettably, on the night of August 18, 2013, Abraham was struck and killed by a drunk driver.  Francis Riscioli, got into his car intoxicated, and while speeding he crossed a double yellow line to pass a slower moving vehicle and in turn fatally struck Abraham as he was trying to walk home after a night out with friends. As the details of that night emerged, and we started piece together those events, we discovered that Abraham consciously took steps to ensure he kept himself and others on the road safe by deciding to walk home instead of driving, an act that would ultimately cost him his life.\r\n\r\nMr. Riscioli did not take these steps.  Instead, on August 18, 2013, no more than 6 weeks after he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence and reckless driving, he got into his car and carelessly took the life of Abraham Rivera.  We assert to you Sir that this was not an accident; Mr. Riscioli violated the terms of his probation, operated a motor vehicle while intoxicated, ignored the posted speed limit signs and AGAIN (for the 2nd time in 6 weeks) was found to be driving on the wrong side of the road.  \r\n\r\nWe as a community, as a family, as friends of Abraham and his loved ones emphatically feel and believe that the proposed sentence of 3 years is not only an insult to Abraham\u2019s memory, but an outrage for the continued safety of our community. A sentence of only 3 years would be wholly insufficient to offer appropriate measured justice for such a careless and reckless act.\r\n\r\nLike many others, Abraham was a father, brother, uncle, son, cousin, friend, and confidant. And we can assure you that his family is no longer whole without him. We all mourn his loss in different ways and as time passes we know our pain will start to heal. But we, as Abraham\u2019s family, as a community, as his friends, need assurances that someone who has proven himself to be a danger to others, who has now taken the life of someone we hold dear, because of his carelessness, will no longer be a threat to others.\r\n\r\nFrancis Riscioli must be held accountable for his utterly careless and reckless actions and most importantly he must serve a sentence that fits the nature of his crime. We respectfully request that his proposed sentence be significantly increased and his driver\u2019s license permanently revoked to ensure that our community and Abraham\u2019s family can truly feel confident that justice has been served and that this man is no longer a danger to others.  If Abraham\u2019s death could potentially save the lives of others then we know our pain and his sacrifice serves a greater purpose.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely appreciate your time in this matter and we are all looking forward to hearing that true and sufficient justice has been served.\r\n\r\nMay Abraham Rest In Peace.\r\n\r\nBy signing this Petition I assert that I am outraged by the proposed sentence of 3 years and request that a more suitable sentence be imposed.","signature_count":872,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/5/ja/un/jmJAuNiAavLFHsa-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":"Criminal Justice","goal":5000,"created_at":"2014-01-08T17:18:33Z","end_at":"2015-01-08T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Irene Cruz","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/6231260","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
