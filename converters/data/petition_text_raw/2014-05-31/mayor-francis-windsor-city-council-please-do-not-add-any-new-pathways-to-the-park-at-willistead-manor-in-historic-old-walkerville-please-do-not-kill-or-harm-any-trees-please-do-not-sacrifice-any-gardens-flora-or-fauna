Please do not kill or harm any trees. Please do not sacrifice any gardens, flora or fauna.","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/mayor-francis-windsor-city-council-please-do-not-add-any-new-pathways-to-the-park-at-willistead-manor-in-historic-old-walkerville-please-do-not-kill-or-harm-any-trees-please-do-not-sacrifice-any-gardens-flora-or-fauna","overview":"<p><strong><span>Stepping through the wrought iron gates into Willistead Park is like stepping back in time.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span>The park offers a rare, peaceful reprieve from the hustle and bustle of everyday life in the city. <span>&nbsp;</span>While within the sanctuary provided by the magnificent wrought iron fence which surrounds this lovely little gem of a park, one feels cut off from the noise and stress of everyday life. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span class=\"null\"><span>This 15.5 acre park is situated in the heart of the former company town of Walkerville, Ontario, founded for his workers by Hiram Walker, distiller of world famous Canadian Club Whisky.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span> The proposed pathway route is drastically out of proportion with the overall size of this small piece of land and will destroy the beauty and tranquility the park currently offers.<span>&nbsp;</span>Way too much green space will be lost. <span>&nbsp;</span>It will no longer be possible for any of us to simply stroll along the central paths in the park taking in the beauty, since the elegant central paths will be gone, and since the new route is too complicated and maze-like. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Safety will be a real&nbsp;concern with this new asphalt pathway route. For one thing, it will no longer be safe for tots to play on the climber and swing-set since the proposed route circles around the play area as well. <span>&nbsp;</span>Parents who usually enjoy relaxing on the benches near the play area will no longer be able to sit and rest. <span>&nbsp;</span>They will feel constant stress instead. <span>&nbsp;</span>Relaxation will no longer be possible for any of us in Willistead Park if the asphalt pathway project&nbsp;is not halted once and for all.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Mayor Francis and Windsor City Council, I implore you to please put a stop to this expensive pathway construction project. <span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I </span><span>humbly</span><span> ask you to reallocate the funds towards the repair and long-term maintenance of the <em>current</em> paths within the park instead to ensure that the park is fully accessible to all visitors. <span>&nbsp;</span>The proposed pathway route would not be ideal for those with mobility issues since the new route is not direct enough. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>It is important to preserve these lovely grounds always, the way they are, so that the legacy of the beautiful manor and grounds bequeathed to us by the Walker family will be enjoyed by future generations the way we, and past generations, have been able to enjoy them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Thank-you very much, Sara Venney</span></p>\r\n<p><span><em>(Supporters, please fill in all required fields.
