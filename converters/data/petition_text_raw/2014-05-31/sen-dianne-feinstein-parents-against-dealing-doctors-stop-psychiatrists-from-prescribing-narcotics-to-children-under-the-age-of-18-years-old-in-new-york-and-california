{"petition_id":1475547,"title":"Sen. Dianne Feinstein: PARENTS AGAINST DEALING DOCTORS: Stop psychiatrists from prescribing narcotics to children under the age of 18 years old in New York and California. ","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/sen-dianne-feinstein-parents-against-dealing-doctors-stop-psychiatrists-from-prescribing-narcotics-to-children-under-the-age-of-18-years-old-in-new-york-and-california","overview":"<p>My beautiful daughter Christina suffered from an anxiety disorder. When she was 14, I took her to a doctor who I thought was reputable and she seemed to have a good repar with her. As a parent, you trust the medical professionals. You get second opinions but you need to rely on the experts. Eveytime my daughter had a medical condition in the past - dislocatable hip at birth requiring an orthopedic specialist; the need for dual strabismus surgery at the age of four requiring an optomologist specialist -- they did their job and they fixed the medical problem. So naively I trusted who I thought was a specialist in her field. I had no idea that my daughter was being prescribed a narcotic for her anxiety. Prescription drugs can often lead to addiction and self medication for these children without the responsible care of competent medical professionals.&nbsp; My beautiful daughter passed away at the age of 22 and I don't want any other parent to have to bury their precious child. Christina was an artist and a photographer. She loved the outdoors and being in nature. There are so many milestones that she will never experience because her life ended prematurely. Please help me stop these doctors who irresponsibly prescribe these medications to children that adversley affect the course of their lives and all too often contribute to the loss of life.</p>","targets":[{"name":"Sen.

Invariably, these doctors do not properly monitor their young patients. They become addicted and then turn to self medication which all too often leads to a loss of life. Please hold these doctors accountable for their irresponsible actions. Enforce stricter restrictions on their ability to prescribe narcotics to children whose frontal lobes have not yet fully developed. This is a nationwide epidemic that needs to be addressed. Let's start in New York and California then hopefully other state legislatures will follow suit.","signature_count":14,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/by/ls/mOBYlsnEhviUVDw-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":"Criminal Justice","goal":100,"created_at":"2014-03-26T15:17:56Z","end_at":"2015-03-26T23:59:59Z","creator_name":null,"creator_url":null,"organization_name":"Unity Wellness Center in Loving Memory of Christina Bostrom","organization_url":"http://api.change.org/organizations/unity_wellness_center_in_loving_memory_of_christina_bostrom"}
