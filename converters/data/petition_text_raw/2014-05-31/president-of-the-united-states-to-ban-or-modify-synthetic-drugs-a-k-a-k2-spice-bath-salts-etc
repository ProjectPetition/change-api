K2, Spice, Bath Salts, etc.).","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/president-of-the-united-states-to-ban-or-modify-synthetic-drugs-a-k-a-k2-spice-bath-salts-etc","overview":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States is already &nbsp;plagued with enough legal / illegal narcotics. K2, Spice, Bath Salts, etc.)&nbsp; are to easily obtained by Children ,&nbsp; Teenagers and Young Adults. There are no tests as to the long term adverse affects of this drug. Should something so dangerous and with so many side affects be so easily obtained by our Children , and should less than savory Businessmen and Shop Owners make profits from it like&nbsp; common drug dealers. I recently lost my Son and Synthetic Marijuana played a major roll in his death. We lived in different states so we communicated either through phone or text. Some of the last conversations I had with my Son , he was so incoherent and I could not understand him. Not long after his Mother took him out of state , to get him away from Synthetic Marijuana (K2).&nbsp; Those would be the last conversation I had with my son because later that week withdrawal symptoms caused him or aided him in the taking of his life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our children face enough problems in this life. Do we really need something this dangerous and as easily attainable as a pack of cigarettes threatening them as well. Why should anymore Americans lose there Sons or Daughters to something that really serves no purpose accept to ruin lives .</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in fact this product is only used as &nbsp;incense or bath salts , there shouldnt be any problem with the Manufacturer including additives to the product making it unsmokeable and uningestible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thats why I included the terms \"modify\" in my petition.&nbsp; The chemical makeup could be changed as well , whereby the ingestion of the product wouldnt cause euphoria.</p>","targets":[{"name":"President of the United States","type":"us_government"}],"letter_body":"To ban or modify Synthetic Drugs (a.k.a.
