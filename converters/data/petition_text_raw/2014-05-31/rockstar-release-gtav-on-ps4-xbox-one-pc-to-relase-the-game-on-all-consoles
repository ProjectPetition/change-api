It would open the market to a lot more people and also would make a lot of your hardcore fans happy. PC version would also be a great idea becsaue of modding and all of the stuff that includes. You dont want to shut out your fans just becasue it would take extra time to make these versions. Thanks I hope you see this and realise you would make a mistake to not release on these platforms.
