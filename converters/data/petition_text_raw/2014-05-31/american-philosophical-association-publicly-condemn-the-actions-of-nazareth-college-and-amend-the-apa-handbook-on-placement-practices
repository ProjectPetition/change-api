{"petition_id":1469203,"title":"American Philosophical Association: Publicly condemn the actions of Nazareth College and amend the APA Handbook on Placement Practices","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/american-philosophical-association-publicly-condemn-the-actions-of-nazareth-college-and-amend-the-apa-handbook-on-placement-practices","overview":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We the undersigned request that the American Philosophical Association (APA) take the following two actions. First, we request that the APA publicly condemn the actions of the hiring committee of Nazareth College's Philosophy Department. That committee recently acted unprofessionally and in bad faith by immediately rescinding an offer in response to a counter-offer, effectively punishing a candidate for entering into negotiations. Second, because the APA Handbook on Placement Practices&nbsp;does not explicitly suggest guidelines for responses to counter-offers or when rescinding an offer might be appropriate, we request the Handbook be amended. (A link to the Handbook and the relevant paragraph are enclosed below) We assume that the most basic norms for good faith negotiations concerning counter-offers and rescinding offers were not made explicit in the Handbook because they were so deeply held and shared. Recent actions have challenged this assumption, so we believe it is time to explicitly address them in the Handbook. Thank you for your assistance in dealing with matters so important to our profession.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;APA Handbook on Placement Practices <a href=\"http://www.apaonline.org/?page=Placement_Handbook\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.apaonline.org/?page=Placement_Handbook</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"In some cases, negotiations after receipt of an offer are possible, although time pressure often limits negotiations. A candidate may, for example, request modifying an offer&rsquo;s provisions concerning salary and benefits, reimbursement of moving expenses, provision of computer and peripherals, teaching duties, course release time, research assistants, clerical or administrative support, and office space. The hiring department should have told the candidate in advance what items are negotiable. Candidates should be aware that, at many institutions, offers are non-negotiable.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","targets":[{"name":"American Philosophical Association","type":"custom"}],"letter_body":"Publicly condemn the actions of Nazareth College and amend the APA Handbook on Placement Practices","signature_count":79,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/1/ib/ay/EzIbAYAoOseFKrQ-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":100,"created_at":"2014-03-19T18:37:18Z","end_at":"2015-03-19T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Chad Kautzer","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/16565246","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
