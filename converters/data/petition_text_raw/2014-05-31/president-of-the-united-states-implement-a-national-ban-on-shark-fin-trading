Shark fins are coveted for their supposed medicinal value, and as a part of status symbols like shark fin soup in China.  The International Union for the Conservation of Nature estimates that a third of all open ocean sharks are threatened by extinction because of finning.  The current US national law regarding shark finning relies on a regulation known as the 5% ratio rule.  The Journal of Fish Biology published an article in 2012 that concluded, \u201cthe generalized 5% ratio used in many of the existing regulations presents a dangerous loophole, which provides an opportunity for \ufb01shers to land extra sharks without consequences.\u201d The illegal trading of shark fins has supported organized crime in Costa Rica and Taiwan, and has put the world\u2019s oceans on the edge of ecological collapse.  The Shark Finning Prohibition Act of 2000 needs to be replaced with stricter regulations that completely ban the taking of sharks, and the trading of their fins.\r\n\r\nHawaii implemented a statewide ban on the trade of shark fins in 2000 that found great success.  The Marine Resource Economics journal found that illegal shark fin imports to Hong Kong from the US decreased by 54% as a result of Hawaii\u2019s ban.  An outright trade ban has proved effective, so Congress needs to consider a national law with the same strength as Hawaii's.","signature_count":293,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/2/rc/ea/HPRceakqmvJPUJA-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":500,"created_at":"2014-03-30T21:01:39Z","end_at":"2015-03-30T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Carl Lavigne","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/87928475","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
