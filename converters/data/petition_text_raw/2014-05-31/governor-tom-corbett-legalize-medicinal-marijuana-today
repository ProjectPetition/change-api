{"petition_id":1423658,"title":"Governor Tom Corbett: Legalize Medicinal Marijuana today","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/governor-tom-corbett-legalize-medicinal-marijuana-today","overview":"<p>Our son Jacob is 15 years old and has Lennox - Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) with medically refractory epilepsy. &nbsp;Jacob has tried over 15 anti-epeleptic medications, the ketogenic diet and brain surgery without gaining control of the seizures. &nbsp;Even though Jacob is the strongest person we know, it is not medically possible for his body to withstand the seizures and side effects when he has had over 5,000 seizures alone in 2013 and over 500 just this month. &nbsp;With LGS comes a diagnosis of Intellectual Diasability. &nbsp;Jacob will not be lighting up a joint with his buddies. Jacob will be perscribed the cannabis oil by his neurologist and it will be given via his feeding tube like his other medications. &nbsp;Medicinal marijuana is the only HOPE available today for Jacob &amp; thousands of others with severe medical conditions.. Picture this, it is a special day, one you have been waiting for. &nbsp;You are about to celebrate with your family as your daughter is about to become a Bat Mitzvah or graduate from college or marry the man of her dreams. &nbsp;You are dressed and about ready to walk out the door when your son suddenly drops to the floor and has an unthinkable amount of seizures. &nbsp;You carry his limp body once again to his bed where he will sleep away yet another day of his life and you &amp; your wife will once again put on your best smiles while inside your hearts are breaking. Seizures effect the whole family. &nbsp;The hope that medicinal marijuana brings is priceless. Living life day to day,&nbsp;hour to hour,&nbsp;minute to minute even second to second waiting for the next seizure is simply not living. &nbsp; Please Governor, lead by example, legalize Medicinal Marijuana so our son will have the fighting chance he deserves. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Gloria &amp; Howard Shotz</p>","targets":[{"name":"Governor Tom Corbett, PA Governor","title":"PA Governor","type":"custom"},{"name":"Lt.
