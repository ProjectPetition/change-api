{"petition_id":1194081,"title":"NBCUniversal - Bravo TV: Cancel Princesses: Long Island","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/nbcuniversal-bravo-tv-cancel-princesses-long-island","overview":"<p>As a 20 something Jewish woman, I am upset, disgusted and offended by the portrayal of young Jewish women, by this show. Jews fight with being stereotyped everyday and this show isn't helping us win the fight. Young Jewish women are strong, independent and educated, which doesn't seem to be part of any episode's storyline. This show portrays the exact opposite of what the religion's values and beliefs are supposed to be about. Judaism is a beautiful religion about family, tradition and community. It is definitely not about finding a husband, having money and drinking, which is what is seen on the show. I personal would never want someone to meet me and think this is what my friends and I are like, and I believe I speak for all young Jewish women in North America. Princesses: Long Island promotes negative Jewish stereotypes and we shouldn't have to stand by and watch this show poorly educate individuals about Jews.</p>","targets":[{"name":"Stephen B.
