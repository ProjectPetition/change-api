While it would be easy to assume this madness will get squashed locally before it has a chance to escalate, Jewish leaders in the Ukraine have been asking for support (see video attached to this petition) precisely to fend off what has, apparently, now occurred.</p>\r\n<p>As of this writing, diplomatic talks are underway (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/UkrDiplomacy20140417\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/UkrDiplomacy20140417</a>), but not necessarily regarding this matter.&nbsp;Regardless of what has happened thusfar politically, we call on President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry to make their influence felt against oppression, to see the Donetsk Jewish registry is not enforced and does not escalate - no matter who does or does not claim responsibility for this.</p>\r\n<p>Please make your voice heard: that the world WILL NOT stand for this, not even for a joke and certainly not for real, not even for one day.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>----</p>\r\n<p>UPDATE: About an hour or two after this petition launched, Google picked up this news:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/KerryRespondsUkrJewReg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/KerryRespondsUkrJewReg</a> - including a statement by US Secretary of State John Kerry denouncing the registry as \"beyond unacceptable. And any of the people who engage in these kinds of activities - from whatever party or whatever ideology or whatever place they crawl out of - there is no place for that.\" So for any additional signers to this petition, I've edited the petition letter to acknowledge this statement.</p>","targets":[{"name":"Secretary of State of the United States","type":"custom"},{"name":"President of the United States","type":"us_government"}],"letter_body":"It has come to my attention that the interim Donetsk, Ukraine leader has supposedly demanded a Jewish registry as political revenge. Real or merely \"provocation\", as Pushelin claims it is, this is unacceptable. Thank you for making a public statement against this. Please keep this on your radar as talks continue, to ensure the Jewish registry is neither enforced nor escalated.","signature_count":1957,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/9/ws/yg/AhwsYgsmCjHXcvm-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":2500,"created_at":"2014-04-17T16:28:13Z","end_at":"2015-04-17T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Patricia de la Mota","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/38146356","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
