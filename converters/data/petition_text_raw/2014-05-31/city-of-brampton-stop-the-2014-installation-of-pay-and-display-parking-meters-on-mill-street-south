{"petition_id":1534500,"title":"City of Brampton: stop the 2014 installation of Pay and Display parking meters on Mill Street South","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/city-of-brampton-stop-the-2014-installation-of-pay-and-display-parking-meters-on-mill-street-south","overview":"<p>In the interest of keeping our downtown looking beautiful, our community being safe and family-friendly, and our neighbourhoods looking heritage-worthy, we, the downtown citizens of the city of Brampton, petition the city to stop the 2014 installation of Pay and Display parking meters on Mill Street South between Queen and Wellington. <br /> <br />It concerns us a great deal that the city will be installing parking meters on Mill Street in front of our homes. We have lived in Brampton for a number of years and often have friends and family come to visit. It is ridiculous that they will now have to pay the city to visit our homes. Installation of parking meters in residential areas such as Mill Street South makes no sense &ndash; especially because there is no commercial or industrial activity on our streets.</p>\r\n<p>We demand that the meter installations be cancelled and the meters not be installed south on Mill Street from Queen to Wellington. It appears to us that the reason for these meters to collect parking revenue from patrons of one hair salon located at the corner of Queen and Mill. Unfortunately, the installation of the meters will only push more parked cars onto Byng Avenue and possibly Wellington Street. This is already an issue for many of us as we suffer the inability to have the roads in front and beside our houses cleaned, the garbage collected, the leaves vacuumed and the snow ploughed due to cars parking on our streets for hours and hours at a time.</p>\r\n<p>If this has been brought about by the increased traffic caused by the hair salon, then the city should be working with the hair salon to come up with parking alternatives. Surely when they provided Ego Salon with a business permit, there must have been some discussion regarding parking requirements. Perhaps Ego could pay for parking space at the insurance company on the southwest corner of Queen and Mill? The neighbourhood residents shouldn&rsquo;t be penalized for the city&rsquo;s lack of foresight regarding parking for this business.</p>\r\n<p>Parking meters will not change that fact, they will continue to push the problem to other streets (much like the 30 minute parking limit on Mill Street and the 2 hour parking on Wellington Street has already done). We do support regular enforcement of currently existing parking restrictions in our area, whereby our streets would be monitored for extended parking and parking tickets issued for violators. Parking meters serve no valid reason other than to give money to the city to pay for a person to walk around giving tickets for people parking their car too long on a public street. Parking meters serve NO other useful purpose. Save the cost of the meters and ticket cars who park longer than the posted length of time.</p>\r\n<p>If the city is determined to install parking meters, what about further west along Queen Street, going in both directions? There is certainly more call for parking meters on Queen Street than there ever would be on our residential Mill Street. An additional question we have is why Mill Street and why not Elizabeth and Wellington Streets that are located closer to downtown and Gage Park?</p>\r\n<p>We are concerned that by installing meters in front of our houses, the city is changing our residential neighbourhood into a commercial district and it isn't right. Main, Queen, Nelson &amp; George are one thing as they are already commercial, but streets like Mill, Elizabeth, Thomas and Wilson are family communities. We don't believe that there is sufficient space for on-street parking on Mill Street South, between Queen and Wellington to ensure the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.</p>","targets":[],"letter_body":"stop the 2014 installation of Pay and Display parking meters on Mill Street South\r\n","signature_count":195,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/4/re/hv/CCREHvvvtYuAKFl-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":250,"created_at":"2014-05-14T20:02:19Z","end_at":"2015-05-31T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Kimberley Popoff","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/94620925","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
