","status":"open","url":"http://api.change.org/petitions/rockstar-games-release-gta-v-on-the-wii-u","overview":"<p>It is simply foolish for Rockstar Games to discriminate against and insult us Wii U enthusiats by witholding the release of GTA V. This next generation console has better gaming performance than the geriatric Xbox 360 and PS3 on which the game is currently restricted to. It's graphics are comparable to Xbox One and PS4, and the game is scheduled to release on those consoles, so why isn't it being released on the Wii U? Your guess is as good as mine. All the theories that people on the internet have come up with seem incorrect and pointless. Nintendo has released many games that are M rated, and GTA should not be discluded. Let us sign this petition in an effort to persuade Rockstar to put fourth the effort of releasing GTA V on the Wii U. Such a good console should not be seperated from what many believe to be the best GTA there has ever been.</p>","targets":[{"name":"Rockstar Games","type":"custom"}],"letter_body":"Release GTA V on the Wii U.","signature_count":11,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/9/dr/fv/lydrFVoJzCxEiJj-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":100,"created_at":"2014-01-14T22:11:55Z","end_at":"2015-01-14T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"PB Ecks","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/76225673","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
