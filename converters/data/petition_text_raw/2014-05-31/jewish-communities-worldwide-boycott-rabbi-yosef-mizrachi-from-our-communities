He does not represent Tora values, distorts halacha and hashgafa, almost always gives non sourced opinions, as well as talking in vile disrespectful tone to the kahal.</p>","targets":[{"name":"Jewish Communities Worldwide","type":"custom"}],"letter_body":"Boycott \"Rabbi\" Yosef Mizrachi from our community","signature_count":13,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/app-assets/petitions/show/default_petition-2dea4f8fdd8a3fa93201db8b1c7cf36d.png","category":null,"goal":100,"created_at":"2014-01-29T01:50:56Z","end_at":"2015-01-29T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Dana Cohen","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/77827236","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
