All this before a court of his peers has the opportunity to review the evidence of the situation. This will likely distort the perception of any future juror that will be asked to determine, without bias, this man&rsquo;s fate. Friends and family are seeking all of the support in this matter and thank you for supporting them.</p>","targets":[{"name":"Tri-Cities Media","type":"custom"}],"letter_body":"Ban all media including TV, Radio and Newspaper from publishing about Crawford Lamka","signature_count":343,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/7/tt/oj/GBTToJtFtcDixsx-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":500,"created_at":"2014-03-07T17:29:51Z","end_at":"2015-03-07T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"amy freund","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/84909783","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
