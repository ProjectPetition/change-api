Secondhand smoke contains 70 cancer-causing chemicals and is a danger to us all. It\u2019s time to protect all workers and families from the dangers of secondhand smoke.\r\n\r\nRecently, South Bend had the opportunity to be a leader for St. Joseph County by protecting workers and families from secondhand smoke and making a healthier South Bend for all of us.  Instead, a few council members chose to delay a smoke-free South Bend, making us all wait for a safer, healthier South Bend and St. Joseph County.\r\n\r\nOn July 14, this issue will be up for another vote.  Smoke-free air is important for all of us, and we strongly urge you to support a smoke-free South Bend this July because everyone deserves the right to breathe smoke-free air.
