We all have heard this before. I recall a German regime singling out a minority. The world should have spoken louder then. We don't need to repeat those same mistakes.</p>\r\n<p>I request Stephen Harper represent Canada's values of inclusiveness and peace by publicly condemning this frightening situation in Russia. Canada can, though its voice of reason, express the danger of these laws to the G8 leaders and, indeed, to all who can speak up.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is what we're talking about:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/gay-teen-dies-after-being-kidnapped-tortured-russia060813\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/gay-teen-dies-after-being-kidnapped-tortured-russia060813</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bilerico.com/2013/07/russian_skinheads_entrapping_torturing_lgbt_teens.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bilerico.com/2013/07/russian_skinheads_entrapping_torturing_lgbt_teens.php</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I need your help to ensure we protect people who are singled out and institutionally hated, simply because they are a minority, different, or threaten the status quo of the majority. We've seen this before.</p>\r\n<p>The fact that the Russian government has enacted these laws also means that LGBT Russian citizens can be victimized, tortured or killed by Russians' who feel they are only acting according to the governments views.</p>\r\n<p>THIS HAS GOT TO STOP NOW! Please help me take action.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","targets":[{"name":"Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada","title":"Prime Minister of Canada","type":"custom"},{"name":"John Baird, Minister of Foreign Affairs","title":"Minister of Foreign Affairs","type":"custom"}],"letter_body":"I am sad to learn that Russia's President Putin has enabled legalized intolerance and persecution of homosexuals. \r\n\r\nWe have seen this before in Germany many years ago but not out of our minds. A country singles out scapegoats and then clamps down on them. The nations of the world then failed millions of people by waiting too long to speak up. \r\n\r\nPlease join us in expressing our Canadian values that intolerance is unacceptable, that hatred cannot be sanctioned, and those laws cannot be supported in the modern world. We HAVE to speak up. We HAVE to speak with other world leaders about this. We MUST be the leaders. \r\n\r\nMr. Harper, you've heard this a millions times: evil prevails when good men fail to act.\r\n\r\n Let's please act together.\r\n\r\n","signature_count":35,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/bi/ta/vsBITacfwGLJLIz-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":"Gay Rights","goal":100000,"created_at":"2013-08-14T00:50:25Z","end_at":"2014-09-13T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"JC Goth","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/6992402","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
