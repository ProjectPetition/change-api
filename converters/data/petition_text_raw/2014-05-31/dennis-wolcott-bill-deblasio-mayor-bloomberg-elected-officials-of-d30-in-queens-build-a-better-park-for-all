However, the funding for 126 Park was eradicated during budget cuts, and the park</p>\r\n<p>was not restored. The play yard is in dismal condition with only one basketball goal, multiple holes and unutilized poles.</p>\r\n<p>The 126 Park would serve the diverse IS 126 student body from Astoria Houses and the surrounding neighborhood. It</p>\r\n<p>is also home to the borough-wide suspension center, and the district&rsquo;s newest gifted and talented program. 72% of the</p>\r\n<p>student body are Hispanic or Black, and 86% qualify for free or reduced price lunch.</p>\r\n<p>Like the beautiful newly renovated play yard park at nearby PS 122, 126 Park would provide an open space for both</p>\r\n<p>students and individuals from the surrounding community after school hours. To complete the park, we estimate a budget</p>\r\n<p>of $110,000.</p>\r\n<p>Please sign this petition to let our elected officials know that establishing healthy play spaces for our community must be</p>\r\n<p>a top priority.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Every NYC child should have a safe play spaces within walking distance of his/her home.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; There is a scarcity of public open spaces in this part of Astoria.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Community members should have shared use of school play yards after hours.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; 86% of students at IS 126 are enrolled in the income based school lunch program.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Programs incorporating physical fitness into school wellness reduce rates of childhood obesity.eone should support this petition</p>","targets":[],"letter_body":"Build a better park for all \r\n","signature_count":140,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/app-assets/petitions/show/default_petition-2dea4f8fdd8a3fa93201db8b1c7cf36d.png","category":null,"goal":200,"created_at":"2013-10-17T04:29:45Z","end_at":"2014-10-17T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Laura Boutwell","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/5120827","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
