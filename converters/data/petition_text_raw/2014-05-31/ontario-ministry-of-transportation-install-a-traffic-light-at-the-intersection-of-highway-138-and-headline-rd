This intersection is dangerous and there is a high crash frequency along the 138 including fatalities.  This intersection is frequently used by regular commuters, school buses and parents transporting children to the nearby school, Ecole Sainte Lucie. \r\nThe right turning lanes off Highway 138 are being used as passing lanes on the right side of the road when traffic should be stopped waiting for a vehicle to turn left onto Headline Road (either direction). We would like safety improvements at this intersection and believe a traffic light would help ease the danger.\r\nThis intersection affects residents of both South Stormont and South Glengarrry but also the many commuters from all the Counties of SD&G.\r\n","signature_count":1165,"image_url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/lq/gm/yWlQGmufWSqMSWK-556x313-cropped.jpg","category":null,"goal":5000,"created_at":"2013-09-07T15:17:57Z","end_at":"2014-09-07T23:59:59Z","creator_name":"Kim Ariagno","creator_url":"http://api.change.org/u/21408432","organization_name":null,"organization_url":null}
