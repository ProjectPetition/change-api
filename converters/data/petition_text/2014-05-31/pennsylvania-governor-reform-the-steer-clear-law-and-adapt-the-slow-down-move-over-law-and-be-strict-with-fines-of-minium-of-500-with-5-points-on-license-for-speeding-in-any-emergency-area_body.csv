Pennsylvania has a \"Steer Clear\" law that does NOTHING. Police does not enfoce this law nor is there public annoucments for this law. US THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMONWEALTH of PENNSYLVANIA want this law changed to the \"SLOW DOWN/MOVE OVER\" Law with speedlimits of 15MPH on public and side roads and 30 MPH speed limits on Highways/Turnpikes. This law will support not only tow trucks,,,"I support the SLOW DOWN/MOVE OVER law and pledge that i will slow down and move over for ALL EMERGENCY VEHICLES. Us the TAXPAYERS want this adapted in our great state of PENNSYLVANIA.
