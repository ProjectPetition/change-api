1361976,"San Francisco 49ers C/O Jed York and Trent Baalke Fire Offensive Coordinator Greg Roman","open","http://api.change.org/petitions/san-francisco-49ers-c-o-jed-york-and-trent-baalke-fire-offensive-coordinator-greg-roman","<p>The San Francisco 49ers need a new direction at the Offensive Coordinator position. The offense will never be able to showcase their ability and win consistently with Greg Roman's conservative (And sometimes outright ridiculous) playcalling. The fans have had enough of this! We all know that this is the main problem with the 49ers offense. Please make this change to ensure a better future for the San Francisco 49ers organization. This is the right move for the future.</p>","San Francisco 49ers Front Office",,,"Fire Offensive Coordinator Greg Roman",9,"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/fh/zj/kefHZjYpndKtBIE-556x313-cropped.jpg",null,100,2013-11-19T05,2015-12-31T23,Ian,Vance,"""http://api.change.org/u/35306283""",null,null
