The idea is to get enough support to put pressure on them to correct it. To that end we'll be contacting both the Police and media once we have enough signatures to be effective. \r\n\r\nWhat's happening here is going to change. Together we can send a strong message to the Toronto Police Service that it has to change now.",384,"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/nc/cj/GCNcCJLszSveGLq-556x313-cropped.jpg",null,500,2013-07-06T02,2014-07-06T23,Benjamin,Mueller-Heaslip,"""http://api.change.org/u/29891986""",null,null
