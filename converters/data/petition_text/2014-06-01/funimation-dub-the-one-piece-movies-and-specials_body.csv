1333424,Funimation: Dub The One Piece Movies and Specials,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/funimation-dub-the-one-piece-movies-and-specials,<p><strong>ATTENTION ONE PIECE FANS!</strong></p>  <p>Have you ever wished Funimation  who has done a great job of dubbing and releasing One Piece in North America  would get ahold of the rights to the movies and specials of One Piece  so that we can legally stream and buy subbed and dubbed versions of these? Well then support this petition!</p>  <p>It is very hard to find some of the One Piece specials  as well as some of the movies. As Funimation has dubbed the anime and two of the movies already  and done it very well  it would make sense to allow these other One Piece movies and specials to be legally available in North America  and be in English. These movies include  One Piece the Movie  Adventure on Clockword Island  Chopper's Kingdom on the Island of the Strange Animals  Dead End Adventure  The Cursed Holy Sword  Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island  The Giant Mechanical Soldier of Karakuri Castle  Episode of Chopper Plus: Bloom in Winter Miracle Sakura  and One Piece Film Z. The specials include  Adventure in the Ocean's Navel  Once Upon the Great Sea! A Father's Huge HUGE Dream!  Protect! The Last Great Performance  The Detective Memoirs of Chief Straw Hat Luffy  Episode of Nami: Tears of a Navigator and the bonds of Friends  Episode of Luffy: Adventure on Hand Island  Episode of Merry: The Tale of One More Friend  and Glorious Island. All of these  while they will take time  money  and talent to dub and released  would not be hard to obtain the righs to. This would give fans the ability to legally purchase and watch these great additions to the world of One Piece. It would also give Funimation several areas for profit. I for one  know I'd buy the One Piece movies and specials. They licensed all the Dragon Ball movies and released them in collections  and seeing as how they've dubbed Episode of Alabasta and Strong World  it doesn't seem like it would be a much different case. Yet another positive for both Funimation  and the actual One Piece Studio  Toei Animation  is that it would cut down pirating  which is what many here in North America feel forced to do. We would love to buy and stream these specials and movies  if only we had the option! Still I would like to rally support for this cause! One Piece fans  spread this petition through forums  help us to be heard by Funimation!</p>,Funimation Productions,custom,You have done a great job of dubbing the One Piece anime  and two of the movies. You have also dubbed all the Dragon Ball movies  for comparison. There is a large audience and area for profit if you considered dubbing the One Piece movies and specials. These movies include  One Piece the Movie  Adventure on Clockword Island  Chopper's Kingdom on the Island of the Strange Animals  Dead End Adventure  The Cursed Holy Sword  Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island  The Giant Mechanical Soldier of Karakuri Castle  Episode of Chopper Plus: Bloom in Winter Miracle Sakura  and One Piece Film Z. The specials include  Adventure in the Ocean's Navel  Once Upon the Great Sea! A Father's Huge HUGE Dream!  Protect! The Last Great Performance  The Detective Memoirs of Chief Straw Hat Luffy  Episode of Nami: Tears of a Navigator and the bonds of Friends  Episode of Luffy: Adventure on Hand Island  Episode of Merry: The Tale of One More Friend  and Glorious Island. Many fans would love the opportunity to legally buy and stream these excellent additions to the world of One Piece. It would also curb pirating  which is what many fans of One Piece feel the need to resort to  which hurts Toei Animation as well as you. You have done a great job so far of dubbing the anime with great voice actors  and keeping everything intact. You are the company we'd want to see officially releasing these movies and specials. Please consider this petition.,21,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/6/xi/rx/XlXirXqgbTLWMtH-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,1000,2013-10-18T05:51:04Z,2014-10-18T23:59:59Z,Wyatt Mund,http://api.change.org/u/65843567,None,None
