1239628,Rockstar release GTAV on PS4/Xbox One/PC: To relase the game on all consoles.,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/rockstar-release-gtav-on-ps4-xbox-one-pc-to-relase-the-game-on-all-consoles,<p>This game should be released on all of these platforms becasue next gen consoles will make the game more realistic compared to current gen consoles.Its not even limited to better graphics  you could have no load times  also more people on multiplayer which brings a more fun experience to us gamers. It would open the market to a lot more people and also would make a lot of your hardcore fans happy. PC version would also be a great idea becsaue of modding and all of the stuff that includes. You dont want to shut out your fans just becasue it would take extra time to make these versions. Thanks I hope you see this and realise you would make a mistake to not release on these platforms. WE THE GAMERS WANT CHANGE </p>,[],[],To relase the game on all consoles.
