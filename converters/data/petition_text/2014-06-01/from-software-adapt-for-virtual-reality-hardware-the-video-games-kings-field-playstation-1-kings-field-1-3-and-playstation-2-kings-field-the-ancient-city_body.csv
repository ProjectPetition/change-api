1485766,From Software: Adapt for "Virtual Reality" hardware the video games: Kings Field (Playstation 1: Kings Field 1-3) and (Playstation 2: Kings Field The Ancient City),open,http://api.change.org/petitions/from-software-adapt-for-virtual-reality-hardware-the-video-games-kings-field-playstation-1-kings-field-1-3-and-playstation-2-kings-field-the-ancient-city,<p>The Kings Field games are the spiritual predecessors and inspiration for the critically acclaimed and highly successful "Souls" video games (Demon's Souls  Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2.)</p>  <p>Each of the games are "first person" and first person games are PERFECT for virtual reality. Why these games? They are beautiful  eerie  atmospheric  challenging and deep. They offer a unique world to explore and experience first hand in virtual reality. Even better is the fact that they are role playing games offering complexity and long term playability.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Riding on the massive and somewhat unexpected success of the "Souls" games there will already be an eager and growing base of gamers ready for the next challenge from From Software to see where it all began and die all over again. This time in Virtual Reality!</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>,Facebook,custom,Adapt for "Virtual Reality" hardware the video games: Kings Field (Playstation 1: Kings Field 1-3) and (Playstation 2: Kings Field The Ancient City),14,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/vy/ub/BzVyuBmCmLwiBCs-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2014-04-06T23:34:31Z,2015-04-06T23:59:59Z,Jeremy Weyrauch,http://api.change.org/u/51380320,None,None
