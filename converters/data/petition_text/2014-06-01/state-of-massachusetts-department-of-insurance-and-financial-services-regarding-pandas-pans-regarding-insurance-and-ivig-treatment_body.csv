1359098,State of Massachusetts Department of Insurance and Financial Services regarding PANDAS/PANS regarding insurance and IVIG treatment,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/state-of-massachusetts-department-of-insurance-and-financial-services-regarding-pandas-pans-regarding-insurance-and-ivig-treatment,<p>Imagine one day your 7 year old child will not go outside  has irrational fears of tornadoes  is pacing at night not sleeping  will only sleep when with you  cannot go to school or cries the whole way due to separation anxiety  this was our life  after antibiotic therapy it got better for a while. Then a cellulitis eye infection started a snow ball effect  now our 15 year old daughter is paranoid to be alone  will not sleep without us  cannot stay in school  has major anxiety and fears  please help us not live out this nightmare over again. &nbsp;This is not a psychiatric disorder  it is an infection that mistakenly attacks the basal ganglia part of the brain that controls behavior and ocd. This disorder is a reaction to inflammation. &nbsp;Our child is suffering due to the politics of medical care  there have been successful studies proving IVIG works for children with PANDAS where antibiotic therapy is not succeeding  please let our child get the treatment she deserves. This treatment is not covered by insurance it costs $1000 per 10lbs of body weight. &nbsp;We are expected to pay out of pocket an estimated $15 000 for 1 treatment. &nbsp;Right now we are paying approximately $150-200 per month just in co-payments and medication  we have tried homeopathic medicine  boosting the immune system with pro-biotics and vitamin D. &nbsp;When your daughter says I cannot wait until I am 16 so that I can get a job and save enough money to help pay for my treatment so that I don't feel like this anymore it is heart breaking. &nbsp;Please sign our petition and help us raise awareness  there are many children like ours out there suffering for the same reasons.</p>,Joint Committee on Financial Services Regarding BIll H 984, Senate & House Members,custom,Insurance Needs to cover IVIG treatments for Pediatric Autoimmune  Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptoccocal Infections or PANDAS/PANS,1727,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/qk/hc/LuqkhCtkJxUcEmu-556x313-cropped.jpg,Health,2500,2013-11-16T02:34:46Z,2014-11-16T23:59:59Z,Lisa Grisolia,http://api.change.org/u/31425908,None,None
