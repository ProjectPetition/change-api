1489408,Nintendo: Create a new Ganon clone and DE-CLONE Captain Falcon in Smash Bros. 4, to give him a move set that truly represents him from his countless iconic appearances in previous F-Zero titles.,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/nintendo-create-a-new-ganon-clone-and-de-clone-captain-falcon-in-smash-bros-4-to-give-him-a-move-set-that-truly-represents-him-from-his-countless-iconic-appearances-in-previous-f-zero-titles,<p>Smash brothers and F-Zero fans around the world were disappointed and heartbroken the day they found out Captain Falcon was a Ganon clone in Smash Bros. Melee. This was an outrage and was completely unacceptable. The fact that this has been accepted over time is very upsetting  and I believe that the only reason this happened was because people did not think there was anything they could do about it  and because they became attached to this this "cloned" move set over time. The latter issue can easily be solved by moving the move set to another character (such as<a href="http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Ghirahim" rel="nofollow">Ghirahim</a>from Skyward Sword)  satisfying people who like themoves provided by Ganon currently. Doing this would free Captain Falcon from his shackles as a "clone" and can open up his gameplay possibilities immensely. I can see some people becoming upset at this change at first  but over time I believe they will come to realize that this was the best decision. Please  to everyone who agrees with this plea  I urge you to sign this petition to help possibly pushMasahiro Sakurai to fix this atrocity.</p>,Nintendo,custom,Create a new Ganon clone and DE-CLONE Captain Falcon in Smash Bros. 4  to give him a move set that truly represents him from his countless iconic appearances in previous F-Zero titles.,5,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/zd/lh/dlZDlHxtybTtDRh-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2014-04-10T18:43:40Z,2015-04-10T23:59:59Z,Carlos Reyes,http://api.change.org/u/3286790,None,None
