1332507,Dennis Wolcott, Bill deBlasio, Mayor Bloomberg, Elected officials of D30 in Queens : Build a better park for all ,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/dennis-wolcott-bill-deblasio-mayor-bloomberg-elected-officials-of-d30-in-queens-build-a-better-park-for-all,<p>Explain why som126 PARK</p>  <p>BUILDING A BETTER PARK FOR ALL</p>  <p>In 2010  Mayor Michael Bloomberg launched an initiative to turn play yards into parks. 126 Park was budgeted to</p>  <p>receive $75 000 for the renovation. However  the funding for 126 Park was eradicated during budget cuts  and the park</p>  <p>was not restored. The play yard is in dismal condition with only one basketball goal  multiple holes and unutilized poles.</p>  <p>The 126 Park would serve the diverse IS 126 student body from Astoria Houses and the surrounding neighborhood. It</p>  <p>is also home to the borough-wide suspension center  and the district&rsquo;s newest gifted and talented program. 72% of the</p>  <p>student body are Hispanic or Black  and 86% qualify for free or reduced price lunch.</p>  <p>Like the beautiful newly renovated play yard park at nearby PS 122  126 Park would provide an open space for both</p>  <p>students and individuals from the surrounding community after school hours. To complete the park  we estimate a budget</p>  <p>of $110 000.</p>  <p>Please sign this petition to let our elected officials know that establishing healthy play spaces for our community must be</p>  <p>a top priority.</p>  <p>&bull; Every NYC child should have a safe play spaces within walking distance of his/her home.</p>  <p>&bull; There is a scarcity of public open spaces in this part of Astoria.</p>  <p>&bull; Community members should have shared use of school play yards after hours.</p>  <p>&bull; 86% of students at IS 126 are enrolled in the income based school lunch program.</p>  <p>&bull; Programs incorporating physical fitness into school wellness reduce rates of childhood obesity.eone should support this petition</p>,[],[],Build a better park for all
