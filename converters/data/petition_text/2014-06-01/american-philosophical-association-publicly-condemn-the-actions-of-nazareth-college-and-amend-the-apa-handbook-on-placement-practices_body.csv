1469203,American Philosophical Association: Publicly condemn the actions of Nazareth College and amend the APA Handbook on Placement Practices,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/american-philosophical-association-publicly-condemn-the-actions-of-nazareth-college-and-amend-the-apa-handbook-on-placement-practices,<p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">We the undersigned request that the American Philosophical Association (APA) take the following two actions. First  we request that the APA publicly condemn the actions of the hiring committee of Nazareth College's Philosophy Department. That committee recently acted unprofessionally and in bad faith by immediately rescinding an offer in response to a counter-offer  effectively punishing a candidate for entering into negotiations. Second  because the APA Handbook on Placement Practices&nbsp;does not explicitly suggest guidelines for responses to counter-offers or when rescinding an offer might be appropriate  we request the Handbook be amended. (A link to the Handbook and the relevant paragraph are enclosed below) We assume that the most basic norms for good faith negotiations concerning counter-offers and rescinding offers were not made explicit in the Handbook because they were so deeply held and shared. Recent actions have challenged this assumption  so we believe it is time to explicitly address them in the Handbook. Thank you for your assistance in dealing with matters so important to our profession.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;APA Handbook on Placement Practices <a href="http://www.apaonline.org/?page=Placement_Handbook" rel="nofollow">http://www.apaonline.org/?page=Placement_Handbook</a></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">"In some cases  negotiations after receipt of an offer are possible  although time pressure often limits negotiations. A candidate may  for example  request modifying an offer&rsquo;s provisions concerning salary and benefits  reimbursement of moving expenses  provision of computer and peripherals  teaching duties  course release time  research assistants  clerical or administrative support  and office space. The hiring department should have told the candidate in advance what items are negotiable. Candidates should be aware that  at many institutions  offers are non-negotiable."</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>,American Philosophical Association,custom,Publicly condemn the actions of Nazareth College and amend the APA Handbook on Placement Practices,79,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/1/ib/ay/EzIbAYAoOseFKrQ-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2014-03-19T18:37:18Z,2015-03-19T23:59:59Z,Chad Kautzer,http://api.change.org/u/16565246,None,None
