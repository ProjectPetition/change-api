1437722,Bethesda Softworks: Release Skyrim: Legendary Edition on PS4!,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/bethesda-softworks-release-skyrim-legendary-edition-on-ps4,<p>TES V: Skyrim is one of the best RPG games which was released on PC  PS3  and Xbox 360 in 2011 with the Legendary Edition released in 2013. <br /><br />Unfortunately  the PS3 and 360 are quite old consoles which cannot handle Skyrim at a high FPS level with Ultra graphics quality and fast load times. <br /><br />Please port the game on PS4  a new generation console which architecture is similar to PC. It won't cost too much  yet people will be happy to get back to Skyrim on a new hardware.&nbsp;<br /><br />P.S. Please feel free to make an Xbox One port as well  yet we'd love to see Skyrim's true beauty on PS4.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks!</p>,Bethesda Softworks,custom,Release a FullHD version of Skyrim: Legendary Edition on PS4!,119,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/9/dq/ex/zaDqEXbJqNapPCc-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,200,2014-02-14T12:38:18Z,2015-02-14T23:59:59Z,None,None,My PlayStation,http://api.change.org/organizations/my_playstation
