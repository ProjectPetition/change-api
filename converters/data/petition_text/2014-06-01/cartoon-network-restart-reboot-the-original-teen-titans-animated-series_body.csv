Rivaling even the likes of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Bringing back the series will bring many viewers back for Cartoon Network and may continue to add viewers if the show is even better then it's predecessor with the addition of talented writers. The opportunity should not missed on this show which is why it should be brought back.,13,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/4/vg/ez/auvGezSnHqBCzDS-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,200000,2014-04-02T23:04:31Z,2015-04-02T23:59:59Z,Mohammed Bhuiyan,http://api.change.org/u/88272618,None,None
