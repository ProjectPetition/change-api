1458500,Tri-Cities Media: Ban all media including TV, Radio and Newspaper from publishing about Crawford Lamka,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/tri-cities-media-ban-all-media-including-tv-radio-and-newspaper-from-publishing-about-crawford-lamka,<p>In recent publications  Crawford Lamka has been given the title &ldquo;Wilmont Killer.&rdquo; This branding the media has phrased is their opinion and their broadcasted prospective on how the rest of the general public should view Crawford. All this before a court of his peers has the opportunity to review the evidence of the situation. This will likely distort the perception of any future juror that will be asked to determine  without bias  this man&rsquo;s fate. Friends and family are seeking all of the support in this matter and thank you for supporting them.</p>,Tri-Cities Media,custom,Ban all media including TV  Radio and Newspaper from publishing about Crawford Lamka,343,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/7/tt/oj/GBTToJtFtcDixsx-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,500,2014-03-07T17:29:51Z,2015-03-07T23:59:59Z,amy freund,http://api.change.org/u/84909783,None,None
