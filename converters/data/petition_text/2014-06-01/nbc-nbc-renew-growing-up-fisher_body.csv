1520812,NBC: NBC: Renew Growing Up Fisher! ,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/nbc-nbc-renew-growing-up-fisher,<p>ABOUT THE SHOW</p>  <p>It's not every family that's brought closer together by divorce  but then again  the Fishers are anything but typical. Take Mel Fisher (J.K. Simmons  "The Closer " "Law &amp; Order")  for example. He's chopping down trees  showing his daughter how to drive  and playing football with his son&hellip; except that Mel's blind. Then there's Joyce (Jenna Elfman  "Dharma &amp; Greg " "1600 Penn")  who is your typical teenager - really into fashion  busy with school - but the problem is she's Mom. That makes it difficult for her actual teenage daughter  Katie (Ava Deluca-Verley  "Southland")  whose advice (and clothes) Joyce is always seeking. At the center of all this is Henry (Eli Baker)  the Fishers' 11-year-old son. Having always been his dad's eyes and wingman  Henry is less than thrilled when his job is outsourced to Mel's new guide dog  Elvis. While the boy is at first reluctant to accept the changes that Elvis brings  adult Henry (voiceover by Jason Bateman  "Arrested Development " "Identity Thief") realizes upon reflection that his parents' split finally allowed the Fishers to become one happy (divorced) family.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Inspired by his own life  DJ Nash ("Up All Night " "Bent") serves as executive producer along with Bateman  Jim Garavente ("Identity Thief") and Tucker Cawley ("Up All Night " "Everybody Loves Raymond"). "Growing Up Fisher" is a production of Universal Television and Aggregate Films.</p>  <p>SOURCE:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nbc.com/growing-up-fisher/about" rel="nofollow">http://www.nbc.com/growing-up-fisher/about</a></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>  <p>Growing Up Fisher is one of the few shows from this decade that I can watch with my whole family without having to worry about awkward moments or non-family moments coming up. It has something everyone can relate to: first crushes  embarrassing parents  and overcoming challenges. It reminds us of how important family is and how anything is possible. This is not just a TV show; it is a life story.&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Let us prove to NBC that this show should be renewed for a second and more.&nbsp;</p>,NBC,custom,
Growing Up Fisher is not just a TV show; it is a life story. It is everyone's story. 

We love this show. People want it back. 

Give it a chance.

Please bring back Growing Up Fisher. Renew it for a second season and more.
