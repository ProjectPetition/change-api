989654,Powerade: If Gatorade can take crazy chemical BVO out of sports drinks, so can you,victory,http://api.change.org/petitions/powerade-if-gatorade-can-take-crazy-chemical-bvo-out-of-sports-drinks-so-can-you,<p>A couple months ago  I found out that one of my favorite drinks  Gatorade&rsquo;s Orange  contained brominated vegetable oil (BVO). According to <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=soda-chemical-cloudy-health-history" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Scientific American</em></a> and other news reports  BVO is patented as a flame retardant and has been banned in Europe and Japan. So I started a Change.org petition asking Gatorade to stop using it. More than 200 000 people signed my petition on <a href="http://www.change.org/Gatorade" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Change.org</a> and we won! <strong>But I learned that BVO is also in other drinks  like Powerade&rsquo;s red fruit punch that is actually sold in my school!</strong></p>  <p>It&rsquo;s weird because Gatorade&rsquo;s fruit punch doesn&rsquo;t have BVO! But Powerade&rsquo;s fruit punch does  and it is probably one of the most popular flavors for my friends. It is so wrong to be selling something like that to a bunch of kids anywhere! What are these companies thinking? I don&rsquo;t want anyone in my family touching that stuff. <strong>Why do these companies put all this weird  crazy stuff in our food and drinks?</strong></p>  <p>After Gatorade agreed to remove BVO from their drinks  a lot of people have been encouraging me to keep going  so now <strong>we&rsquo;re back to officially ask Powerade</strong> to do the same thing! It&rsquo;s common sense that sports drinks here shouldn&rsquo;t contain crazy ingredients that are banned in entire countries because of health concerns.</p>  <p>I&rsquo;ve read some crazy information about how BVO and the ingredient bromine can build up in people&rsquo;s bodies over time and how the chemical is linked to problems with hormones and fertility and stuff like that. I also saw that Powerade may be the official drink of the NCAA for college athletes! Athletes shouldn&rsquo;t be drinking that! NASCAR also has a deal with Powerade  but I don&rsquo;t know why unless it&rsquo;s to put out those engine fires!</p>  <p>Gatorade did an amazing thing and agreed to stop using BVO  and I hope the entire beverage industry is paying attention. <strong>Consumers don&rsquo;t want BVO and every day that they keep it in there makes us trust them less.</strong></p>  <p>For now though  Powerade pretends to be a healthy sports drink and it has to decide if it wants to be the only one (there will be no BVO in Gatorade or Vitamin Water) that still uses a chemical banned in Europe and Japan and that its main competitor  Gatorade  agreed to remove.</p>  <p><strong>I know Powerade will listen. If they sell those things overseas without BVO  why risk my health and my friends&rsquo; health?</strong></p>  <p>*Please sign and share to support me*</p>,Adrian White (Marketing manager), Marketing manager,custom,I heard that Gatorade recently decided to stop using brominated vegetable oil in its products. I think that was a great thing for them to do. It took 200 000 people to weigh in on Change.org last time  but I hope you avoid the controversy and remove this chemical  too.

Considering it is banned in Europe and Japan  Id like to think my health is as important as the people who live there! I hope youll agree.

A crazy chemical linked to flame retardants has no place in our sports drinks.

Thank you for your consideration.,59374,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/kz/tk/chkztKnOWHLbLdc-556x313-cropped.jpg,Health,75000,2013-01-30T14:40:54Z,2015-02-04T23:59:59Z,Sarah Kavanagh,http://api.change.org/u/33175052,None,None
