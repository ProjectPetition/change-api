1407553,Honorable Judge Baratta- Easton Pennsylvania: Significantly increase the proposed sentence of Francis Riscioli,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/honorable-judge-baratta-easton-pennsylvania-significantly-increase-the-proposed-sentence-of-francis-riscioli,<p>On August 18  2013 Abraham Rivera was struck and killed by a drunk driver in Easton Pennsylvania while he was walking home from a night out with friends.</p>  <p>The driver Francis Riscioli was intoxicated  speeding and driving on the wrong side of the road when he struck Abraham with his car.</p>  <p>The facts of the case show that Mr. Riscioli had been charged with a DUI and reckless driving (driving the wrong way down a one way street) just 6 weeks prior to his "accident" with Abraham.</p>  <p>Family and friends of Abraham recently have been notified the Judge is considering just a measly 3 year sentence for this reckless and careless crime.</p>  <p>The next court date is the first week of February and we want to send a message to the Judge and the community that driving under the influence is just as dangerous as weilding a loaded gun into a crowded mall and should be treated as such.</p>  <p>We want a harsh and lenghty sentence to be imposed and his drivers license PERMANENTLY revoked.</p>,Honorable Judge Stephen Baratta, 669 washington St. Easton, PA 18042,custom,We are writing to you on behalf of much needed justice for Abraham Rivera.  Regrettably  on the night of August 18  2013  Abraham was struck and killed by a drunk driver.  Francis Riscioli  got into his car intoxicated  and while speeding he crossed a double yellow line to pass a slower moving vehicle and in turn fatally struck Abraham as he was trying to walk home after a night out with friends. As the details of that night emerged  and we started piece together those events  we discovered that Abraham consciously took steps to ensure he kept himself and others on the road safe by deciding to walk home instead of driving  an act that would ultimately cost him his life.

Mr. Riscioli did not take these steps.  Instead  on August 18  2013  no more than 6 weeks after he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence and reckless driving  he got into his car and carelessly took the life of Abraham Rivera.  We assert to you Sir that this was not an accident; Mr. Riscioli violated the terms of his probation  operated a motor vehicle while intoxicated  ignored the posted speed limit signs and AGAIN (for the 2nd time in 6 weeks) was found to be driving on the wrong side of the road.  

We as a community  as a family  as friends of Abraham and his loved ones emphatically feel and believe that the proposed sentence of 3 years is not only an insult to Abrahams memory  but an outrage for the continued safety of our community. A sentence of only 3 years would be wholly insufficient to offer appropriate measured justice for such a careless and reckless act.

Like many others  Abraham was a father  brother  uncle  son  cousin  friend  and confidant. And we can assure you that his family is no longer whole without him. We all mourn his loss in different ways and as time passes we know our pain will start to heal. But we  as Abrahams family  as a community  as his friends  need assurances that someone who has proven himself to be a danger to others  who has now taken the life of someone we hold dear  because of his carelessness  will no longer be a threat to others.

Francis Riscioli must be held accountable for his utterly careless and reckless actions and most importantly he must serve a sentence that fits the nature of his crime. We respectfully request that his proposed sentence be significantly increased and his drivers license permanently revoked to ensure that our community and Abrahams family can truly feel confident that justice has been served and that this man is no longer a danger to others.  If Abrahams death could potentially save the lives of others then we know our pain and his sacrifice serves a greater purpose.

We sincerely appreciate your time in this matter and we are all looking forward to hearing that true and sufficient justice has been served.

May Abraham Rest In Peace.

By signing this Petition I assert that I am outraged by the proposed sentence of 3 years and request that a more suitable sentence be imposed.,872,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/5/ja/un/jmJAuNiAavLFHsa-556x313-cropped.jpg,Criminal Justice,5000,2014-01-08T17:18:33Z,2015-01-08T23:59:59Z,Irene Cruz,http://api.change.org/u/6231260,None,None
