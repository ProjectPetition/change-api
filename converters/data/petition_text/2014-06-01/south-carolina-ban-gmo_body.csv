1323950,South Carolina: Ban GMO,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/south-carolina-ban-gmo,<p>I am asking South Carolina  as a start of hopefully something bigger and better  to ban GMO. The reason for this is because there has been many scientific reports leading to the conclusion that GMO is a dangerous procedure leading to plants that spread  along with their ownselves  uncanny genetic results that cause humans to procure many physical and emotional aliments  such as ADD  arthiritis and even cancer. If you care any bit about yourself and others health then I plead you to sign this petition to remove and ban all GMO plants and products from South Carolina.</p>,Rep.
