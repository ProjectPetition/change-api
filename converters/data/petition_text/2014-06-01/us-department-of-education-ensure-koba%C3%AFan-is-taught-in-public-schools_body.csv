1417935,US Department of Education: Ensure Kobaan is taught in public schools,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/us-department-of-education-ensure-koba%C3%AFan-is-taught-in-public-schools,<p>Koba&iuml;an was the language of the settlers on the now extinct planet of&nbsp;Koba&iuml;a. Although the expedition turned out to be a total failure  the venture was important since it was the first attempt by humans to colonize another planet. Now  knowledge of the beautifully expressive language&nbsp;Koba&iuml;an is becoming harder to come by as the number of people who speak and understand the language decreases. It is essential that we don't allow the&nbsp;Koba&iuml;an language and culture to become forgotten  and in order to do this we need to enlist those who have studied the language to teach it at public schools.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>,US Department of Education,custom,Please take action to ensure that the dying language of Kobaan is saved by being taught in public schools to the upcoming generation. Kobaan is at grave risk of becoming extinct  and with it a part of human culture will become lost.,40,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/app-assets/petitions/show/default_petition-2dea4f8fdd8a3fa93201db8b1c7cf36d.png,None,100,2014-01-22T18:35:41Z,2015-01-22T23:59:59Z,Thomas Snarky,http://api.change.org/u/77120628,None,None
