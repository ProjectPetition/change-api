1505866,Time is running out: Protect Iowa from dangerous frac sand mining!,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/time-is-running-out-protect-iowa-from-dangerous-frac-sand-mining,<p>Tell Governor Branstad and the Iowa state legislature to protect our most ecologically rich and diverse lands by putting a halt to frac sand mining in Iowa.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The presence of fine-grained silica sand  also known as &ldquo;frac sand &rdquo; has Northeastern Iowa in the mining industry&rsquo;s cross hairs. They want to blast away entire hills to get to it  leaving behind permanent scars on our lands that will never fully heal. This mining can also cause air and water pollution  and it&rsquo;s a threat to communities&rsquo; quality of life. That&rsquo;s what our neighbors in Wisconsin are dealing with as frac sand mining has exploded in their state in recent years.&nbsp;</p>  <p>When the plans for mining were first introduced in our state  Iowans organized and came together in protest  persuading two counties to enact moratoria on frac sand mining &ndash; but they&rsquo;re only temporary and will expire this year if we don&rsquo;t take action. To protect Iowa&rsquo;s lands for good  we need a moratorium across Iowa.&nbsp;</p>  <p>We&rsquo;re gathering signatures across the state RIGHT NOW to send to Governor Branstad and the state legislature telling them to protect Iowa&rsquo;s beautiful natural lands by kicking out these mining companies. Will you add your name?</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>,Iowa State House,us_government,When frac sand mining proposals were first introduced in two Northeastern Iowa counties  Iowans organized and came together in protest  persuading the local governments to enact moratoria on frac sand mining. This was an important first step in protecting our states natural beauty  but these moratoria expire and they only cover a portion of our state.  

Thats why Im writing to urge you to support a full state-wide moratorium on frac sand mining in Iowa. 

These lands are home to some of our states most ecologically rich and diverse areas. They are our states heritage. If the mining industry is allowed to exploit these areas  they will literally blast away entire hills and bluffs  leaving behind permanent scars that will lower land values and never truly heal. This mining can also cause air and water pollution  and its a threat to our communities quality of life.

The people of Northeastern Iowa dont want these mines  and neither do I. Support a state-wide moratorium and tell the frac sand mining industry they are not welcome here in Iowa! ,915,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/zx/qj/aeZxQJJYopwZTBH-556x313-cropped.jpg,Environment,1000,2014-05-01T17:43:29Z,2015-05-01T23:59:59Z,None,None,League of Conservation Voters,http://api.change.org/organizations/lcv
