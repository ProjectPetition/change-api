Over the past few years the City has taken some great steps to make our streets safer for everyone  especially local children who walk or bike to school.

Examples include the addition of:

1) High-visibility zebra striping to crosswalks on Lorain Rd.  
2) Flashing pedestrian beacons on Huntington Dr.  and
3) A bicycle lane on Del Mar Ave. to calm traffic and help local students safely bike to San Marino High School. 

Each of these measures has made it easier for local residents to lead healthier  more active lives by integrating physical activity into their everyday routines.

By signing this petition I am underlining my support for the City's development of a Pedestrian and Bicycle Master Plan to make San Marino streets safer for residents of all ages. ,21,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/cg/of/wwcgOfRFnfIzqah-556x313-cropped.jpg,Health,100,2014-04-10T23:53:23Z,2014-08-10T23:59:59Z,None,None,Day One, Inc.,http://api.change.org/organizations/dayone
