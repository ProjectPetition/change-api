1486772,Jennifer Solari: Nominate Female Heroines for the MTV Movie Awards Best Hero Award,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/jennifer-solari-nominate-female-heroines-for-the-mtv-movie-awards-best-hero-award,<p>In April 2014 I was watching MTV's channel when a commercial for the MTV Movie Awards came on. I have heard of the network&rsquo;s award show before  but since I hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to check it out  I knew little about it. As I searched online to see who this year's nominees were  I read all of the different categories  paying particular interest to the diversity MTV tried to show throughout the nominations for each category. <strong>The one category that stood out to me the most was that of Best Hero</strong> - mainly because <strong><a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/2014/best-hero/" rel="nofollow">all of the heroes nominated were male</a>.</strong> I thought to myself  in a year with such powerful heroines portrayed on the big screen  why couldn't MTV think of even one to nominate?</p>  <p>In this past year there have been such great heroines in some very successful films  including Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen in <em>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</em> which made a whopping <a href="http://www.deadline.com/tag/the-hunger-games-catching-fire/" rel="nofollow">$158 million opening weekend</a> and Shailene Woodley as Tris Prior in <em>Divergent</em> which made <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/divergent-weekend-box-office-muppets-most-wanted/" rel="nofollow">$54.6 million opening weekend</a>. In both films there was a major female protagonist and heroine  which shows <strong>there is no way there were no female heroes to choose from to nominate for the Best Hero award.</strong></p>  <p>So this is my ask to MTV - <strong>MTV should have at least 1/2 female nominations for the Best Hero award.</strong> Will you help me make this happen? I want to see inspiring and powerful female heroines being nominated  being recognized. <strong>Sign this petition today to let MTV know there are plenty of heroines in this year's movies to nominate as Best Hero for the MTV Movie Awards.</strong> The MTV Movie Awards are set for Sunday  April 13  2014. We need to get this message to MTV before the award show so they know heroes are not only portrayed by male actors. MTV may not know it  but by only nominating male actors for the Best Hero award  they are sending a message that female actors on-screen  and the girls they inspire off-screen  can't be heroes too. <a href="http://www.nyinterconnect.com/mtv/" rel="nofollow">59.2% of MTV viewers are female</a> - that means MTV is saying more than half of the network&rsquo;s viewers can&rsquo;t be heroes themselves because there are no female heroines in films worthy enough of being nominated. So please  <strong>help me change the way MTV chooses nominees for their Best Hero award today.</strong></p>  <p><em>Photo credits: <a href="http://www.mtv.com" rel="nofollow">www.mtv.com</a></em></p>,Jennifer Solari, Vice President of Communications for MTV,custom,Nominate Female Heroines for the MTV Movie Awards Best Hero Award,382,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/nm/ez/janMezjHnmopoeq-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,1000,2014-04-08T01:15:11Z,2015-04-30T23:59:59Z,Rebecca Ruvalcaba,http://api.change.org/u/rebeccar,None,None
