1496250,McDonald's Canada: Add A Veggie Burger Option To The McDonald's Menu,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/mcdonald-s-canada-add-a-veggie-burger-option-to-the-mcdonald-s-menu,<p>McDonalds.ca launched a marketing campaign where Canadians can have their questions about McDonald's answered online at YourQuestions.McDonalds.ca. Several people have asked why there is no veggie burger option and the response from McDonald's goes a little something like this: "While the Veggie Burger was a delicious choice  we did not see a large demand from our customers for this product  so we removed it from the menu." Let's show McDonald's there is a demand for this delicious healthy  vegetarian option and see if we can get it on the menu again!&nbsp;</p>  <p>According to Dietitians of Canada approximately 4% of the Canadian population is vegetarian. Although this is a relatively small number  the hope for a higher vegetarian option demand should not be lost. Plenty of meat-eaters could benefit from a vegetarian alternative. Counting calories for weight loss? Diagnosed with high cholesterol? These are just a few of the reasons one could benefit from a vegetarian fast food option even with choosing it just once a week replacing the traditional beef patty.</p>  <p><span>Located on just about every street corner McDonald's boasts convenience at cheap prices and speedy service. Currently  the only vegetarian options they offer are french fries  or salads without chicken. Let's face it  you can't make a hearty meal out of either. Competing fast food restaurants such as Burger King and Harvey's offer a vegetarian burger option so why not McDonald's?! They shouldn't have to miss out on this part of the market if we can show them that there is in fact a demand!</span></p>,McDonald's Canada,custom,I would like to invite you to consider the idea to add a veggie burger option to the McDonald's Canadian menu. ,42,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/4/yi/oq/YiyIOQhCADDfaMP-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2014-04-19T21:53:11Z,2015-04-19T23:59:59Z,Jillian B,http://api.change.org/u/jillianb,None,None
