1240574,Gongshow Gear Inc.: Create inclusive advertising that honors women who play hockey.,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/gongshow-gear-inc-create-inclusive-advertising-that-honors-women-who-play-hockey-2,<p>Recently I took my daughter  who is a terrific hockey player  to a store called "Hockey Life." The vast preponderance of images in the store were of men and boys. Near a display of clothing manufactured by Gongshow Gear Inc. was a poster advertising the Gongshow clothing line with a picture of young men--clearly hockey players--on a beach. Around them and draped over them in postures of sexual submission were girls in skimpy bikinis.</p>  <p>When I checked out the Gongshow Gear company website the text and images support our impression that this is a company that still believes hockey is exclusively a men's sport  that the hockey life is a boy's life  and that that the value of women to the sport of hockey resides in the degree to which they provide visual and physical pleasure to men.</p>  <p>The world of athletics has changed  but clothing manufacturers like Gongshow Gear Inc. are not keeping pace. The "hockey life" is not just a man's life  if indeed it ever was. Girls are taking to the ice in increasing numbers  playing strong and tough and smart. The game and the life are better for their presence in it. Girls should be honored for their dedication to sport and for their accomplishments as athletes  not represented as merely the sexual objects of boys. Companies that predicate their corporate identity on a love of any sport should contribute to the vitality of that sport by recognizing the accomplishments of women athletes and by encouraging girls to be something more in and for that sport than cheerleaders or trophy wives.</p>  <p>I'm so proud of my daughter's accomplishments as an athlete and so impressed by the ways in which my daughter and her teammates are learning and embodying self-actualization through their participation in the sport of hockey. It's time for companies like Gongshow Gear Inc. to get with the program and show girl athletes like my daughter and her teammates images of women who  like them  are proud athletes: girls who are strong  powerful  and beautiful in their own right.</p>,Gongshow Gear Inc.,custom,If Gongshow Gear Inc. really wants to celebrate the hockey life it should recognize that women athletes are an integral part of that life  not because of the pleasure they give to men  but because they are also playing the sport and playing it well. Please create inclusive advertising that honors women who play hockey. Show our daughters and our sons the strength and power as well as the beauty of women's athleticism.
