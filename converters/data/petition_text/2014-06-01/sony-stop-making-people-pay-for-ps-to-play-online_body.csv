1496270,Sony: Stop making people pay for PS+ to play online,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/sony-stop-making-people-pay-for-ps-to-play-online,Are you sick of owning only HALF of the expensive games you buy for the PS4? I know I am  I'm fed up with it. Forcing people to pay to play a portion of a game they already bought is disgusting. They are only making people pay because they want more money. They don't need to make you pay. Its been proven that they did just fine with the PS3 and that didn't force you to pay for online. I know I'm not making a good argument here  there is just so much to say about having to pay for something that you should already own. Please dont idly stand by and let Sony ripoff their loyal customers  lets end this before it gets out of hand.,SONY,custom,Stop making people pay for PS+ to play online,11,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/bz/ig/SAbziGNiQyjgIgE-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2014-04-19T22:46:04Z,2015-04-19T23:59:59Z,Ian Vidales,http://api.change.org/u/88619630,None,None
