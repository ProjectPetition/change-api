Let's try to get people who love what they're doing on the radio and play big venues  instead of the ones who do it for the money! Sign this petition so we can get Patent Pending to play at Madison Square Garden before 2014 ends.</p>  <p>(btw: at the bottom it's supposed to say "To: Madison Square Garden" not "To: Patent Pending")</p>,Patent Pending,custom,Have Patent Pending Play Madison Square Garden,57,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/7/wl/zr/nawlZrRFIiZSwqE-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2013-12-30T18:27:12Z,2014-12-31T23:59:59Z,cat mastro,http://api.change.org/u/74662714,None,None
