1495798,Joe Watson: Stop selling puppies at Petland, promote adoption!,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/joe-watson-stop-selling-puppies-at-petland-promote-adoption,<p>Petland is notorious for not taking proper care of their in store puppies. Several dogs crammed into a tiny space  living in their own excrement  and even eating their own feces. They walk on a wire grated floor  making it difficult for them to walk on a normal floor leading to development problems and growth issues. Every time I set foot in a Petland majority of dogs have dried feces and/or urine caked on their fur. It's time someone took a stand for these poor pups and the conditions they live in. Petland sells dogs from puppy mills  this has been inspected and proved by the USDA. In puppy mills dogs are bred continuously until they die of exhaustion - often inbred which leads to serious health complications in puppies. Some of the dogs even have forged paperwork  I've witnessed with my own eyes. It breaks my heart that these puppies have gone to homes with irreversible illnesses  all the while Petland knew and still allowed their employees to sell the dog. They care more for the dollar than the overall well-being of these poor animals. The ridiculous price tags for a dog that isn't even registered or a pedigree is just absolutely uncalled for. Please help us take action to end this. Let's all work together to save lives and end puppy mill suffering. End puppy selling and promote adopting!
