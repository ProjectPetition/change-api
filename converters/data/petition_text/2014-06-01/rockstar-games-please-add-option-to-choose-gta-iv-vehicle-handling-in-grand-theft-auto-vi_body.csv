1312405,Rockstar Games: Please add option to choose GTA IV vehicle handling in Grand Theft Auto VI,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/rockstar-games-please-add-option-to-choose-gta-iv-vehicle-handling-in-grand-theft-auto-vi,<p>Since the release of GTA IV  there has been a split among the fanbase's opinions&nbsp;regarding the&nbsp;drastic&nbsp;change in vehicle handling that was first introduced in GTA IV. Some liked the new semi-simulation-style vehicle handling &nbsp;while others hated it and preferred the classic arcade-style as&nbsp;seen in past GTA games. For some  this change ruined their experience with GTA IV.</p>  <p>Now a similar&nbsp;situation is happening with the release of GTA V and it shows there's 2 main groups in your fanbase with very different preferences in vehicle handling  those who&nbsp;prefer&nbsp;semi-simulation-style handling and those who prefer arcade-style handling. Adding an option in the menu to change tne handling style would solve this&nbsp;problem and bring much joy to many of us who prefer semi-simulation-style handling.</p>  <p>So please Rockstar Games  add an option to choose realistic handling in your future games.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Thank You</p>,[],[],Please add option to choose GTA IV vehicle handling in Grand Theft Auto VI.
