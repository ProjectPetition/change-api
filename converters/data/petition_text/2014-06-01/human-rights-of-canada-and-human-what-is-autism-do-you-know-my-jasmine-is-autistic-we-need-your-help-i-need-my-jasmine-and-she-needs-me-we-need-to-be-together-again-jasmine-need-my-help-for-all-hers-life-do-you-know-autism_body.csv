I have never had a drinking violation ticket. In 2002 I married Janice Mayfield who is a Canadian citizen  our daughter Jasmine was born in 2007. I gave up my job when our daughter was three months old because my wife was unable to care for her. I was with Jasmine day and night for six years  I was her father and mother. Many people around us were aware of Jasmine's conditions  I always kept in touch with her school teachers and her family docter. I was also involved with a few organizations involving children with special needs. Everyone I knew admired the amount of time and effort that was involved  not to mention the passion and love that I had for my daughter. Jasmine and I were like two bodies sharing one soul  there was nothing I would'nt do for her. At the age of three we realized that there was a lack of progress in her development. She was dianosed with autism  from that moment I promised to dedicate my entire life doing everything I could to keep her safe  happy and healthy. Jasmine is now six years old  she still eats baby food. I have tried giving her healthy alternatives such as avocado  honey  wheat and sweet potatoes. I have always made sure that she received the proper nutrients. I am proud to say that she is happy  healthy and full of energy  I have done my very best to provide her with everything she needed. I am sorry to say that I am also suffering from a disability  I have hearing problems that has required me to have surgery on my right ear. Dr. Westberg who did my surgery mentioned that I would need my left ear done as well.<br /> Everything was running smoothly until we received a letter from Immigration which noted I had to go and meet with them. I went to Immigration with my lawyer and my wife. While I was there I was told by one of the officers that I had to leave Canada in one month. I was shocked and speechless  why is this happening? what did I do wrong? what was going to happen to my Jasmine? My simple but happy life with my family had turned upside down. I was devastated and was filled with a great loss of never seeing my daughter again. Jasmine has only three people in her life  myself her mom and her grandmother. She was about to lose the one person that has been with her day and night since birth. I believed that Canada was a country made of principals  human rights and democracy. How could such a thing happen to us? My daughter was no longer happy  she knew that something was wrong. She was no longer playful and full of energy  I did'nt know what to do. Thinking of never seeing my beautiful daughter again was unimaginable. I was so depressed that I decided the only option was to end my life  I was nothing without Jasmine.<br /> I was taken to the hospital without proper care and was surrounded by immigration authorities. The next day they sent me to a prision in Vancouver  the following day I went to the immigration detention center. This place was horrible and filled with very aggressive prision guards. I was naked and searched  then I was taken to cell number three. They gave me a very heavy coat to wear  I had to wear it for fourty days. I was heavily controlled and under survelliance 24/7. I was'nt allowed to do anything  not enen take a bath or shower. When the time came that I was allowed to take a bath  I had four guards with me. I was hand cuffed from behind and my feet were chained. When it was time for my hearing before the judge  I was hand cuffed  chained and bare foot. The court was located at the immigration building. There was a judge  my lawyer and a few officers. The whole process took just a few minutes and I was'nt allowed to say anything.<br /> I was detained for almost one and a half months and then escorted to the airport. I was heading to Germany and then to Iran. I was escorted all the way to Germany by three immigration officers. At the airport I had some of my belongings returned except for my drivers licence and my care card. I am now in Iran  depressed and devastated. I have so many questions that have been left unanswered. A country like Canada that critizes and treats people like prisoners is not the same country that I once loved. How can a person be hand cuffed  chained and treated like an animal and not have the right to speak for himself. Even the least democratic country would'nt do what Canada has done to a six year old autistic child. They have killed my Jasmine's soul and destroyed her life. They have taken her father who was the only one who cared and looked after her  we were everything to each other. Canada took away my daughters happiness  there is no joy left in her. The government of Canada thinks because of Jasmine's disability  that she has no feelings and thoughts of her own. They are wrong  she knows that I was taken away and she needs me more then ever. When we were together  she always wanted me to wrap my arms around her so she could fall asleep. She liked when I played with her hair and played games with her. She used to be sensitive and passionate  now she is depressed and lost without me. She has lost weight and I'm extremely worried. I will hold Canada responsible for what they have done to me and my family. I will hold them responsible if anything happens to my Jasmine. She was my soul  my life and my heart  she was my everything and my only reason for living. I hold the government of Canada responsible  particulary Jason Kenney  the former minister of immigration for signing my deportation order. He destroyed our lives and I have no desire to live without my Jasmine.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><br /> I hope you can understand  how i feel and help me  with this petition  my last option  to do the right thing.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">My wife Janice Mayfield <a href="mailto:jmayfield68@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">jmayfield68@gmail.com</a>&nbsp; 1033 praerie AVE poco bc</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">V3B 1S3 Canada&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tle:+1 778 668 0767</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><br /> Thanks<br /> Naser Bayat</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>,Stephen Harper, 80 wellington street Ottawa ON K1A 0A2,custom,Hi
