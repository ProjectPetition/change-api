1368273,Ivanna: Lift all of the dog breed-specific bans!,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/ivanna-lift-all-of-the-dog-breed-specific-bans,<p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp; We don't support breed-specific legislation. Research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources. As an alternative to breed-specific policies  we want a community-based approach to prevent dog bites. And ultimately  we think that's a much more promising way to build stronger communities of pets and pet owners. &nbsp;</p>  <p>The types of people who look to exploit dogs aren't deterred by breed regulations. When their communities establish a ban  these people just seek out new  unregulated breeds. And the simple fact is that dogs of any breed can become dangerous when they're intentionally or unintentionally raised to be aggressive. &nbsp;</p>  <p>We  as the people of our community and our state  propose another option other than breed-specific bans.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  <p>Here are a few stipulations we have come up with: &nbsp; -Requiring muzzling in public &nbsp; -Requiring leash in public &nbsp;</p>  <p>-Requiring fence or chain of some sort for inner-city dog(s)</p>  <p>&nbsp; -Carrying a liability insurance of a specified amount</p>  <p>&nbsp; -Displaying of a dangerous dog(s) sign at residence of dangerous dog(s) and color coded collar in public &nbsp;</p>  <p>-Microchipping and identification of owner and dog(s) &nbsp;</p>  <p>-Mandatory spay and neuter of unregistered dog(s) &nbsp;</p>  <p>-Requiring testing by vet to a note signs of a dangerous dog(s) at certain age&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  <p>-Any owner that has not had their dog(s) registered by a licensed vet will have their dog(s) taken away  and/or receive a fine as well as penalty &nbsp;</p>  <p>-Any owner that receives a fine and/or penalty for not registetime their dog(s) &nbsp;after two times will lose privileges of owning a dog(s)</p>  <p>&nbsp; As a responsible pet owner  I register &amp; license my dogs yearly. We know that banning these breeds has not stopped breeders from breeding them  nor has it stopped the number of dog bites and fatalities in the city as well as state. As we know any breed of dog can bite. &nbsp;</p>  <p>Thank you for your time. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; P.S-A link to two videos:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  <p>-pitbull meets baby-&nbsp;<a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7spoxdXUK2o&amp;desktop_uri=/watch?v=7spoxdXUK2o" rel="nofollow">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7spoxdXUK2o&amp;desktop_uri=/watch?v=7spoxdXUK2o</a></p>  <p>&nbsp; -family dog and baby-&nbsp;<a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HO8Rn5XTK_0&amp;desktop_uri=/watch?v=HO8Rn5XTK_0" rel="nofollow">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HO8Rn5XTK_0&amp;desktop_uri=/watch?v=HO8Rn5XTK_0</a> &nbsp;</p>  <p>As you can see in the first video  the dog listens to commands. &nbsp; And a photo at the top of the page to show these "dangerous dogs" of the 1900s  they calle them "Nanny dogs".</p>,Ivanna, N/A,custom,Kansas State Senate
