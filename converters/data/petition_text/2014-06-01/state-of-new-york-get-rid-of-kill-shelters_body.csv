1442188,State of New York.: Get rid of kill shelters,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/state-of-new-york-get-rid-of-kill-shelters,I really think it's in humane to kill perfectly healthy dogs. I think that there's should be no such thing as killing dogs or any animal for that matter. But dogs are eauthanized every day. It shouldn't be. Dogs should be given the opportunity to be given a second chance. They were created on this earth for us to love and care about them. Not kill them.,State of New York.,custom,Get rid of kill shelters,58,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/app-assets/petitions/show/default_petition-2dea4f8fdd8a3fa93201db8b1c7cf36d.png,None,100,2014-02-20T05:08:55Z,2015-02-20T23:59:59Z,Ann Marie Fenza,http://api.change.org/u/80695874,None,None
