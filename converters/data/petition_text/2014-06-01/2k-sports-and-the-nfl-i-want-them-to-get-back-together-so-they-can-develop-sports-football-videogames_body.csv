1334223,2K Sports and the NFL: I want them to get back together so they can develop sports football videogames,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/2k-sports-and-the-nfl-i-want-them-to-get-back-together-so-they-can-develop-sports-football-videogames,<p>There needs to be healthy competition. I am a huge sports fan and I as well as a lot of gamers who want choice when it comes to football videogames. EA Sports has the rights to the NFL in a stranglehold which means they are monopolizing the football gaming industry. This needs to change. Please sign my petitions so the NFL will know that giving 2K sports some licensing for sports games will not only be profitable but will bring football gaming into the next generation.</p>,[],[],I want them to get back together so they can develop sports football videogames,14,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/6/tn/ma/lvTNmAGpJwczxEk-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2013-10-18T22:25:05Z,2014-10-18T23:59:59Z,Danny Neeley,http://api.change.org/u/65905704,None,None
