1469315,Philip Morris and Altria Group: Stop cruel animal testing for tobacco products,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/philip-morris-and-altria-group-stop-cruel-animal-testing-for-tobacco-products,<p>I'm a college student who cares about the welfare of animals  and <strong>want your help to tell Philip Morris International and its owners at Altria Group to stop testing cigarettes and tobacco products on animals!</strong></p>  <p>A couple years ago  I learned about the tobacco industry's cruel experiments that are conducted on helpless animals. According to PETA's website  <strong>Philip Morris stuffed thousands of rats into tiny canisters and pumped tobacco smoke directly into their noses six hours a day for 90 consecutive days.</strong> The rats were then killed and dissected in order to examine the harm caused to their bodies! I even read a very recent study from this month where Altria (the company that owns Philip Morris in the US) did tests to expose groups of male and female rats to smoke for 4 hours a day for two weeks!</p>  <p>That is animal cruelty paid for by Philip Morris!</p>  <p>I already know how unhealthy cigarettes and other tobacco products are for humans. 480 000 human deaths each year are caused by tobacco products. These outrageous and needless animal experiments need to be replaced before more animals die a tragic death for pointless research that is helping tobacco companies delay real action that will help people!</p>  <p>Manufacturers can effectively use human-based research  human epidemiological and clinical studies  and cutting edge non-animal in vitro technology if they really must test anything. <strong>Despite this cruelty and the alternatives  Philip Morris refuses to lay off animals and use only non-animal testing methods.</strong></p>  <p>Just a few weeks ago I was excited to hear that Lorillard Inc.  the third biggest tobacco company in the U.S. (they make Newport brand cigarettes)  announced it will stop animal testing for its products. It's time for Philip Morris to do the same  and I need your help to ask them to do it.</p>  <p>I've been able to meet so many people who share a passion for protecting animals and learn so much about the power one person has to make a difference. <strong>Now I'm looking to use the power of online connections again and ask for your signature on my Change.org petition to help animals who have no voice.</strong></p>  <p>Thank you.</p>,Michael S. Werley (Altria Group), Altria Group,custom,Stop cruel animal testing for tobacco products 

There's no excuse to treat animals so cruelly  especially when alternatives exist! ,157353,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/xt/lt/cJxTLtCWJRJIcDS-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,200000,2014-03-19T19:50:49Z,2015-03-19T23:59:59Z,Jordan Turner,http://api.change.org/u/2209155,None,None
