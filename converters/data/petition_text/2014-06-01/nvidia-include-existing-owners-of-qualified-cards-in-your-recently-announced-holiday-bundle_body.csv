1336185,Nvidia: Include existing owners of qualified cards in your recently announced "Holiday Bundle".,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/nvidia-include-existing-owners-of-qualified-cards-in-your-recently-announced-holiday-bundle,<p>ATI Technologies Inc. (owned by AMD) has been rewarding customers with AAA games for quite some time with their "Gaming Evolved" program. &nbsp;Nvidia on the other hand has historically been quite stingy when it comes to offering free content with their products. &nbsp;With superior products on the market  Nvidia was able to get away with this for a few generations  while ATI was playing catch up. Now that ATI's products have literally evolved  and have become once again competitive with Nvidia  their continued support of the "Gaming Evolved" program has been a thorn in Nvidia's side. Nvidia has unsuccessfully tried a few different strategies to counter ATI's bundles  including offering in game credits for popular Free-To-Play games. Unfortunately for Nvidia  many of their customers found that tactic to be an insult to their intelligence as the value added by such an offer couldn't match the value that multiple AAA games offers. Nvidia has apparently learned a few things from their many blunders  and has finally announced a decent bundle in the "Holiday Bundle". On the other hand  Nvidia has been slow to realize that bundles need to be timed appropriately  and this one is no exception. Instead of planning this bundle ahead of a product release with a specific end date  they decided to tie it to an existing line of products. Doing so not only hurts their customers  but it will ultimately come back to bite them. The reason for this comes down to basic psychology. People who have already invested heavily in the qualifying products of this announcement now have this dirty feeling of being taken advantage of. As technology depreciates in value so quickly these days  those early adopters who make the large investment ahead of the curve  quite frequently experience the feeling of guilt after making such a large investment on a product that will loose the majority of it's value in a very short period of time. However  as lovers of technology  these buyers are used to the feeling of buyers remorse and have over the years come to terms with this vicious cycle. They find ways to see the value in the product  to justify their purchase  even if it isn't there. They realize the product will come down in price  but at the same time  they don't feel like they are really missing out on anything during that time. So  Nvidia's announcement  while exciting to those buyers who were waiting for prices to drop  feels like a slap in the face to everyone who is already invested. Consider for the moment that you invest in two 770 GTXs and an Nvidia Shield. Before tax you would be spending approximately $900 for the base model graphics cards and an additional $250 on the Shield. Add tax to that and you are easily spending more than $1200 on Nvidia products. Now  lets say you did that on October 27th. You might get two copies of Batman: Arkham Origins  one per card. That is a $120 retail value. Not too bad. It's a little value added to your purchase  and you can share a copy of the game with a friend or family member. However  if you had waited one more day  in addition to those two copies of Batman: Arkham Origins  you would be entitled to two copies of Assassin's Creed IV (2 x $60 MSRP)  two copies of Splinter Cell: Blacklist(2 x $60 MSRP)  and $100 rebate on the Shield. That equates to a total of $340 of additional value added to your purchase.... for waiting a single day! That said  what Nvidia has effectively done is spit on it's most loyal customers. The backlash of such an action will be fierce  should Nvidia not change this bundle to include existing owners of qualified cards. It may not come right away  but I assure you  it will come soon enough... and ATI will be the one who reaps the rewards!</p>,[],[],Include existing owners of qualified cards in your recently announced "Holiday Bundle".,27,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/1/rg/af/SbrGafyPperyCXJ-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2013-10-21T19:37:48Z,2014-10-21T23:59:59Z,Scott Schuster,http://api.change.org/u/35198421,None,None
