Secondhand smoke contains 70 cancer-causing chemicals and is a danger to us all. Its time to protect all workers and families from the dangers of secondhand smoke.

Recently  South Bend had the opportunity to be a leader for St. Joseph County by protecting workers and families from secondhand smoke and making a healthier South Bend for all of us.  Instead  a few council members chose to delay a smoke-free South Bend  making us all wait for a safer  healthier South Bend and St. Joseph County.

On July 14  this issue will be up for another vote.  Smoke-free air is important for all of us  and we strongly urge you to support a smoke-free South Bend this July because everyone deserves the right to breathe smoke-free air.  ,78,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/0/it/ne/XziTNezUVsTBcmd-556x313-cropped.jpg,Health,100,2014-05-21T22:35:10Z,2015-05-21T23:59:59Z,None,None,American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network - Indiana,http://api.change.org/organizations/acs_can_in
