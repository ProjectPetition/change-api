1333982,MSAD 28 School Board: Maintain MSAD 28 Custodial Staff, do not outsource services.,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/msad-28-school-board-maintain-msad-28-custodial-staff-do-not-outsource-services,<p>Keep our school community safe. Do not outsource our school custodians  who are an important part of the school community. They not only keep the buildings safe and clean  they usher students safely into and out of the buildings  chaperone activities  and respond to daily safety needs. The custodial staff works hard to make sure our buildings are safe and clean for all who enter -- community members  school employees  and students. &nbsp; Outsourcing threatens the safety of the students and staff. Our custodians know who belongs in each building and who doesn't. This is not something an outside contractor will be able to do. &nbsp;The MSAD 28 faculty uses the buildings on weekends and weekends and deserve to know that the custodians are to be trusted and invested in our buildings. &nbsp; &nbsp; Please keep our MSAD28 custodians and say no to outsourcing!&nbsp;</p>  <p class="salutation">Sincerely &nbsp;<br />[Your name]</p>  <p><a class="collapse" rel="nofollow">Less&nbsp;</a></p>,[],[],Maintain MSAD 28 Custodial Staff  do not outsource services.,163,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/2/de/rj/yoDeRJAHvxroEQG-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,200,2013-10-18T17:40:08Z,2014-10-18T23:59:59Z,None,None,MSAD28 Staff,http://api.change.org/organizations/crms_faculty
