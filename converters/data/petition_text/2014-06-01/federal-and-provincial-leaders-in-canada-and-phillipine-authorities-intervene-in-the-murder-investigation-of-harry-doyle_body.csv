His wife Jane was charged and the arrest warrant was issued in Aug. 2013. Jane fled to Canada very shortly after Harry was murdered. Jane knew she was being questioned and perhaps considered a suspect when she fled. At the time she fled Jane was pregnant  with what Police are saying  with the baby of Harry's bodyguard. The bodyguard has been charged and has been arrested. Please help speed the process of extradition of Jane Doyle. People want Justice.
