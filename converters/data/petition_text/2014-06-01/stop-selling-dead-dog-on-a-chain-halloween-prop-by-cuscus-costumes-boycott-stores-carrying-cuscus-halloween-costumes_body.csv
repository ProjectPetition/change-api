1305444,Stop selling "Dead Dog on a Chain"  Halloween prop by CusCus Costumes: Boycott stores carrying CusCus Halloween Costumes.,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/stop-selling-dead-dog-on-a-chain-halloween-prop-by-cuscus-costumes-boycott-stores-carrying-cuscus-halloween-costumes,<p>To portray to children and teens that it is acceptable to represent animal torture and abuse on Halloween is inappropriate. As a society we need to stand up against any portrayal or act of abuse towards animals. Animal abuse is rampant in the United States. By requesting discontinuing the sale of this prop and others like it  we take a positive step forward in creating role models to future generations.</p>,[],[],Boycott stores carrying CusCus Halloween Costumes.
