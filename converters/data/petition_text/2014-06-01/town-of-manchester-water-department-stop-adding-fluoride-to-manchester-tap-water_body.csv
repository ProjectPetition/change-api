1524608,Town of Manchester Water Department: Stop adding fluoride to Manchester tap water!,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/town-of-manchester-water-department-stop-adding-fluoride-to-manchester-tap-water,<p>A chemical called Hydrofluorosilicic Acid is currently being used to fluoridate Manchester's public water supply. This is a toxic waste by-product of phosphate fertilizer production that contains arsenic  mercury and radionuclides. It has also been shown to leach lead from pipes into the water supply.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"></p> <p>The number of people in Connecticut receiving fluoridated water is 2 350 532 according to the Center of Disease Control.</p> <p>There is approximately 1 milligram of fluoride in every liter of water provided by the Town of Manchester. In the year 2011  the town produced 1.87 Billion gallons of water or approximately 5.13 Million gallons a day. This equates to more than 6 tons of fluoride added to Manchester's Community Water Supply in just one year.</p> <p></p> <p class="MsoNormal">Research has found that consumption of fluoridated water is associated with lowered IQ in children  bone cancer in boys  skeletal and dental fluorosis  hypothyroidism  kidney damage  pineal gland damage and other adverse health effects.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">It is a colorless and odorless chemical that is added to our Community Water Supply every day as a free medical treatment from the government that supposedly helps prevent tooth decay.</p> <p>However  the largest U.S. study comparing tooth decay between those drinking fluoridated vs. non-fluoridated water found that there was no-significant difference (Brunelle &amp; Carlos  1990). Other research shows that there is no relation between dental carries (tooth decay) and the amount of fluoride ingested (Warren et al.  2009).</p> <p class="MsoNormal"></p> <p class="MsoNormal">Forcing the public  including our children  to consume fluoridated water as a medical treatment infringes on our right to informed consent. The United States' Center of Disease Control admits on their website that it is a method of consumption without consent.</p> <p>Fluoride from other sources prevents tooth decay as well  whether from toothpaste  mouth rinses  professionally applied fluoride treatments  or prescription fluoride supplements. These methods of delivering fluoride  however  are more costly than water fluoridation and require a CONSCIOUS DECISION to use them.</p> <p>If you look back at history you will find that fluoridated drinking water was introduced to the community water supply by Hitler during his reign in Germany because of its ability to create a more docile and compliant society. They eliminated fluoride from the drinking water after the reunification of Germany.</p> <p>One of the little known facts about this practice is that over 90% of the World does not fluoridate their water. The United States  which fluoridates over 70% of its water supplies  has more people drinking fluoridated water than the rest of the world combined. Most developed nations  including all of Japan and 97% of Western Europe do not fluoridate their water.</p> <p></p> <p>Regardless of why this hazardous chemical is being wilfully added to our water  it is important to stand up for our right to informed consent. We have the right to eliminate this harmful substance from our homes and it is our duty to create a better way of life for ourselves and for future generations.</p> <p>For specific studies pertaining to these adverse health effects please visit:<a href="http://www.fluoridealert.org/" rel="nofollow">www.FluorideAlert.org</a> and <a href="http://www.cof-cof.ca/" rel="nofollow">www.cof-cof.ca</a></p> <p>For more information on Manchester's Water Supply please visit:</p> <p><a href="http://www.townofmanchester.org/Water/documents/CCR2011WaterQualityReport.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.townofmanchester.org/Water/documents/CCR2011WaterQualityReport.pdf</a></p> <p>For statistics and other information on National fluoridation visit:</p> <p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2012stats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2012stats.htm</a></p> <p>Follow our Facebook page for updates on this cause:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p class="MsoNormal"></p>,Town of Manchester,custom,Stop adding fluoride to Manchester tap water!,10,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/5/uv/xd/TyuvXdRagIgaifh-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2014-05-12T07:17:34Z,2015-05-12T23:59:59Z,Jordan Yeats,http://api.change.org/u/93568136,None,None
