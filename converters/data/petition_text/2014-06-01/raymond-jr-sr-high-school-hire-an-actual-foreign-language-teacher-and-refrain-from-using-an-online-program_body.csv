1340239,Raymond Jr / Sr High School: Hire an actual foreign language teacher and refrain from using an online program.,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/raymond-jr-sr-high-school-hire-an-actual-foreign-language-teacher-and-refrain-from-using-an-online-program,<p>At my school in Raymond  Washington  we are taught foreign language by means of an online program known as "Apex Learning". However  many students agree that a human being should be teaching the class. For me at least  learning a foreign language on a program has proven itself to be quite difficult. Machines can never replace human beings as teachers. Since this is an online program  students have a better chance of cheating and getting away with it than they would if there was a human teaching the class. If a student is having a hard time understanding a subject  a teacher may better explain to the student what they are not understanding. With a program  you're stuck with what you get. Please sign my petition so that we (the students) may have a higher value of foreign language education.</p>,[],[],Thank you very much for helping me reach one step further into getting a foreign language teacher for my school. It really means a lot that you are helping the students and I. If there is something you'd like me to aide you in  don't hesitate to tell me what it is.,76,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/ul/nm/lAULNMqGmgrcqbk-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2013-10-26T21:07:57Z,2014-10-26T23:59:59Z,Christopher Gundersen,http://api.change.org/u/62537010,None,None
