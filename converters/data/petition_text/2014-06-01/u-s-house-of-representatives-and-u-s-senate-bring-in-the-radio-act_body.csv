1503953,U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate: Bring In the Radio Act,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/u-s-house-of-representatives-and-u-s-senate-bring-in-the-radio-act,<p>Ever since Fox news had been around here for a while by making up fake reports in our country  there are citizens out there that get angry because of this. In Canada  they had passed in their "Radio Act" to ban any fake news report. Now  we need to do the same thing too by shuting down any fake news report that gets us to the point that we get angry at the GOP. We need to use our voice to tell the Federal Government to bring in that act to stop Fox News for once.</p>,U.S. Senate,us_government,Bring In the Radio Act,8,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/0/mj/ev/HbmJEVmOWnwdasl-556x313-cropped.jpg,None,100,2014-04-29T16:02:04Z,2015-04-29T23:59:59Z,Jeff Shurling,http://api.change.org/u/87093433,None,None
