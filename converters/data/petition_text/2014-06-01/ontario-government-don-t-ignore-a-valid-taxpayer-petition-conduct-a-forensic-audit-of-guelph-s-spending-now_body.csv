Kathleen Wynne, Premier, Government of Ontario,custom,Please respond immediately to the petition submitted on October 1  2013 on behalf of Guelph property taxpayers by conducting a forensic audit of the City of Guelphs finances and operations.  This is an important first step for Guelph toward getting its fiscal problems under control.  It is also important to other towns and cities in Ontario because it will show them how to get help if they are facing similar challenges.  

Property taxpayers in Guelph  and all across Ontario -- have every right to expect that you will follow through on this petition and conduct this audit.   By responding positively and quickly to  this request from property taxpayers in Guelph  the Government of Ontario will clearly demonstrate that (1) it is concerned about its citizens  and (2) it is responsive to their needs when sent a direct request to do something that is legally and morally a provincial government responsibility.
