1423658,Governor Tom Corbett: Legalize Medicinal Marijuana today,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/governor-tom-corbett-legalize-medicinal-marijuana-today,<p>Our son Jacob is 15 years old and has Lennox - Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) with medically refractory epilepsy. &nbsp;Jacob has tried over 15 anti-epeleptic medications  the ketogenic diet and brain surgery without gaining control of the seizures. &nbsp;Even though Jacob is the strongest person we know  it is not medically possible for his body to withstand the seizures and side effects when he has had over 5 000 seizures alone in 2013 and over 500 just this month. &nbsp;With LGS comes a diagnosis of Intellectual Diasability. &nbsp;Jacob will not be lighting up a joint with his buddies. Jacob will be perscribed the cannabis oil by his neurologist and it will be given via his feeding tube like his other medications. &nbsp;Medicinal marijuana is the only HOPE available today for Jacob &amp; thousands of others with severe medical conditions.. Picture this  it is a special day  one you have been waiting for. &nbsp;You are about to celebrate with your family as your daughter is about to become a Bat Mitzvah or graduate from college or marry the man of her dreams. &nbsp;You are dressed and about ready to walk out the door when your son suddenly drops to the floor and has an unthinkable amount of seizures. &nbsp;You carry his limp body once again to his bed where he will sleep away yet another day of his life and you &amp; your wife will once again put on your best smiles while inside your hearts are breaking. Seizures effect the whole family. &nbsp;The hope that medicinal marijuana brings is priceless. Living life day to day &nbsp;hour to hour &nbsp;minute to minute even second to second waiting for the next seizure is simply not living. &nbsp; Please Governor  lead by example  legalize Medicinal Marijuana so our son will have the fighting chance he deserves. &nbsp;</p>  <p>Gloria &amp; Howard Shotz</p>,Lt. Gov Jim Cawley,custom,Please legalize Medicinal Marijuana today.  Jacob Shotz is 15 years old and had 5 000 seizures in 2013 and over 500 in January alone.  No child or family should have to endure such heart ache and pain when a viable solution is at their fingertips. It could be someone you love.,570,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/8/mt/ya/koMtYasbzPgFlYz-556x313-cropped.jpg,Health,5000,2014-01-30T01:55:56Z,2015-01-30T23:59:59Z,Gloria Shotz,http://api.change.org/u/15133561,None,None
