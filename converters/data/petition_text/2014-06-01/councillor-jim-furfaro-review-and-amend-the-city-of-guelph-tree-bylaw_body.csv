The existing City of Guelph Tree Bylaw needs to be reviewed and amended.

The current bylaw does not regulate lots under .5 acres (i.e. most of the residential lots in town).

The existing bylaw is far too lenient and allows residential owners to cut down mature  healthy trees on lots under .5 acres without good cause.

Over the last several years numerous healthy  mature trees have been cut down for no good reason whatsoever. This needless destruction ruins the beauty of our neighbourhoods and our community  it reduces the green canopy of the City of Guelph  it destroys shade  it reduces our clean air  it destroys animals' habitats  and it has a negative impact on our overall sustainability as a city and a region.

This bylaw needs to be amended to protect trees (at least 10 centimetres in diameter) from damage or destruction regardless of the size of the residential lot. ,17,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/0/zz/fm/dnZZFMUnyzIVqpK-556x313-cropped.jpg,Environment,100,2014-05-02T20:41:31Z,2015-05-02T23:59:59Z,None,None,Concern Resident,http://api.change.org/organizations/concern_resident
