I personally have always loved the connection between Candice Accola's Caroline Forbes and Joseph Morgan's Klaus Mikaelson. They have a beautiful once in a lifetime connection. Ever since there first scene in 3x11 "Our Town" I've never seen this before or since.There connection was instant magnetic  so compelling  breathtaking  chills all over and running down your spine kind of conncetion. The kind of Romance were u just jump up and scream I want more and thirst and crave for more and more. I speak for the whole Klaroline fandom and myself.

I feel we the fandom deserve crossovers at least. I understand that they are on seperate shows and have different things going on yes but  Our point is Klaroline is far from over period. Us supporters of both shows  The Originals  and The Vampire Diaries deserve more scenes between the two. Crossovers  and hopefully soon because I feel we deserve that at least. Maybe start with them talking on the phone. Not a text (actual Talking) to each other in a episode then more talking in upcoming episodes. So we at least get that to start off with then start crossovers.

Thats what this petition is about because we've been here for years keeping the ratings up watching loyally and waiting for our favorite couple to be together finally when it is right. Now since TVD100 it seems like its right because Caroline admitted all her feelings and desires for Klaus. Klaus has always chose her. He always said "Love Is A Vampires Greatest Weakness" But  When hes's with Caroline  Klaus surrendered his heart to Caroline for someone like Klaus that's deep because  with anyone else even his own siblings who hes been with for thousands of years he has never done that. He gave up Revenge for her  He's the only man who was interested in her and never said a horrible word about her.

He praises her She is his light and He is her light.Klaus also said in 4 x23 "I intend to be your last love However long it takes" There is so much potential with this couple I just would love to see where it goes and I know All of the Klaroliner's would as well.

 It seems like Julie Plec doesnt want them together from what interviews I've read say. She say not right now  but  I feel right now is perfect for them to at least be talking on the phone and have some kind of connection.So that's why Im petitioning this CW Network Please hear us out and really think about this because if something isnt done ratings Im sure will drop.Not because of me I watch both shows but other people just might stop I dont want that to happen but  I can't control what others do.

We The Loyal Fans have made The Originals possible by watching Loyally every Tuesday at 8:00 pm  and every Thursday at 8:00 pm as well and tweet about it all the time on Twitter.
