1292238,FAR-West's Entertain-or-Die showcasing requirement must go!,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/far-west-s-entertain-or-die-showcasing-requirement-must-go,<p><span><span><span><strong>IN A NUTSHELL:</strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> Does the Western chapter of Folk Alliance International (FAR-West) have an "Entertain-Or-Die" requirement of its Official Showcase applicants? Of course not. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><em><span>Not in so many words.</span></em></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> This petition concerns application and judging criteria used by the showcase committee and judges that plainly states that applicants who are not entertainers will not be considered. [Such applicants are not literately being told to die. Nobody thinks this.]&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span>Though many non-entertaining folk musicians are excellent performers  this severely curtails their performance and employment opportunities.&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span>Applicants are also expected to have a moderately high understanding of audio/video technology; many good folk musicians lack such understanding.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span>By signing this petition you are addressing the leaders of a regional chapter of an international service organization for folk music in its broadest definition. You are telling them that this practice &mdash;as frequently worded&mdash; redefines folk music as a branch of the entertainment industry. Since it is not  this trivializes all folk music including that which deliberately entertains.You are telling the leadership of FAR-West that this practice as presently worded must not continue past the FAR-West annual conference of October 2013. You are also telling them that the audio/video requirements of applicants need to be thought through more carefully.</p>  <p><em>Having read this far  do you understand what this petition is all about? If so  there is no need to read further. You can now skip below to the petition itself and sign it. In speaking with people  however  I have discovered it&rsquo;s quite a knotty issue and not as easy to understand as I had thought  especially if you are not familiar with Folk Alliance. If still undecided and still interested  please read on:</em></p>  <p><strong>CONTINUING IN MORE DETAIL:&nbsp;</strong>But wait &mdash;you may well ask&mdash; isn&rsquo;t it all entertainment? Two old guys playing fiddle together in the kitchen: aren&rsquo;t they entertaining each other? If so  then ask yourself: why bring it up? If it&rsquo;s all entertainment  why  as of 2012  require showcase applicants to be entertainers?</p>  <p>Then  isn&rsquo;t it all just a matter of semantics? What if the word &lsquo;engage&rsquo; had been used instead of the word &lsquo;entertain&rsquo;? Don&rsquo;t they basically mean the same thing? No  not at all. A musician engages with their art and with their presence as an artist. A musician can also engage with add-ons like costumes  stage patter  laser shows etc. That kind of engagement is called entertainment. Engagement and entertainment can coexist but often they do not. They are two different things.</p>  <p>But the Offcial Showcases take place on a stage. Aren't stages designed for entertainers? Some are. Some aren't. Remember that a great deal of classical music engages large audiences without entertaining them much at all. A stage and an audience do not by definition require an entertainer.</p>  <p>And isn&rsquo;t entertainment determined by the entertainee not the entertainer? What entertains me may not entertain anybody else. This is indeed another way of defining entertainment. However  the application requirements that this petition seeks to change clearly place the responsibility on the applicant. We might all ask at this point  how then can anybody judge what is entertaining and what is not? A simpler argument  perhaps.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><span><span><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> showcase coordinator Peggy Glenn and her team worked very hard and enthusiastically to make the 2012 and 2013 Official Showcases a success. Though the unintended result of their application requirements are bad &mdash;very bad&mdash; for Folk Alliance and and the folk music community of FAR-West  it is FAR-West's leadership that this petition addresses. If you reading this want only to direct ill feelings &mdash;legitimate as they <em>MAY</em> be&mdash; about the 2012 and 2013 official showcases and their selectees  <em>DO NOT SIGN THIS PETITION</em>. [As far as I'm concerned  Peggy  her team and the entertainers they selected should be congratulated; there is no reason to assume that the showcase entertainers are not also artists of high quality selected through a rigorous and painstaking process. Only the restrictive application requirements are being questioned here.] If you believe (as I do) that the mission of Folk Alliance is vitally important for folk music and that FAR-West can turn this negative into a positive  then <em>SIGN THE PETITION TODAY</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span><span><span><span><strong>WHAT IS FAR-West?</strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> Folk Alliance Region West (FAR-West) is by far the most prominent service organization for acoustic  folk  roots and traditional musicians  organizations and presenters in a region t</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>hat </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>includes but is not limited to</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> Ala</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>ska  Hawaii  Washington  Oregon  Idaho and Arizona. FAR-West is an entirely voluteer run organization. A central feature of FAR-West's annual conference is a series of Official Showcases designed to acquaint membership with the best music of it's members and that of artists of other chapters and to show who and what the folk arts of this region are. The FAR-West Conference (and FAR-West) itself presents a myriad of networking opportunities for members of the folk community. It's officially condoned Unofficial Showcases [aka: Guerilla Showcases] provide exposure for artists in a highly competitive but still viable environment.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span><span><span><span><strong>THE ARGUMENT:</strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span>This petition does not seek to deter either membership in Folk Alliance or participation in any of its conferences. The petition addresses a mindset that has steadily recognized the undisputed value of the entertaining folk musician to the exclusion of all who would self-identify as folk musicians but for whom entertainment is irrelevant.</p>  <p><span><span><span><span><span>Over the past two years  FAR-West showcase applicants have been told they </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><em><span>must</span></em></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> be entertainers. Writing in FolkAlliance's list serve in 2012  showcase coordinator Peggy Glenn stated that applicants are: &ldquo;Not musicians - not singers &ndash; not songwriters - not g</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>uitar players &ndash; but  entertainers.&rdquo; The posting that congratulated and announced the selectees of this year&rsquo;s Official Showcase observed: "entertainment is the key word."</span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span><span><span><span><span>This is contrary to FAR-West's own mission statement (&ldquo;to strengthen the ecology for folk music </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><em><span>and</span></em></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> build stronger artists . . . &rdquo; [</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.far-west.org/conference/mission.html" rel="nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://www.far-west.org/conference/mission.html</span></span></span></span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>]) and is detrimental to the artistic wellbeing of many of our colleagues  many of whom have already left the organization. While the emphasis on entertainment can be seen as strengthening some  even many  artists; it is hard to see how the emphasis also strengthens the ecology of folk music especially when entertaining is meaningless to many of its forms or sub-genres. It is easier to see  however  that the entertainment emphasis only strengthens the ecology of the entertainment business.</span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span><span><span><span><span>FAR-West  however  is making little or no effort to (1) justify or clarify the use and importance of a word (entertainment) not to be found in its mission statement or that of its chapter granting organization [</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.folkalliance.org/about-fai/" rel="nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://www.folkalliance.org/about-fai/</span></span></span></span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>]; (2)&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span>assist members in understanding the implications and effects of this new emphasis on entertainment; (3) to assist folk music presenters in promoting folk music that engages more than it entertains and/or (4)<span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;to address marginalization of its members (current  past and prospective) caused by their emphasis on entertainment at the expense of art  a word to be found twice in FAR-West's mission statement. [A non-profit organization&rsquo;s mission statement is very important because  among other things  it helps justify its claim to tax exemption. Deviation from a mission statement can expose both the organization and its board members to legal action from members or funders.]</span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p>This is neither the traditional verses the commercial nor the art versus entertainment argument. This is a holistic argument. What if showcase applicants were told:&nbsp;"Entertainers need not apply. Authentic folk artists only!" I assure you I would be asking you to sign a petition defending the validity of the entertaining folk musician.</p>  <p>In a way  this is an issue of apples and oranges. The oranges  however  are insisting that apples don&rsquo;t exist.</p>  <p>Why the 'entertainers only' requirement is so detrimental is twofold:</p>  <p>(1) Entertainment value is irrelevant when considering folk music intended to outrage and confront [protest songs  for example]; folk music intended for ritual purposes [spirituals  for example]; practical household functions [lullabies]; work aids [military cadence] and folk music for social purposes [contra dance tunes]. These aspects are rarely even presented as the content of folk entertainment yet they are still defining attributes of folk music. They are effectively cut from the showcase.</p>  <p>(2) it joins the music industry at large in placing ever-increasing fiscal and time-consuming burdens on the independent artist who  to take on the role of entertainer  must also gain expertise in ever-changing marketing  computer and internet technologies  and audio and video production. This last aspect directly concerns official showcases:</p>  <p>FAR-West showcase applicants must submit live performances recorded to audio or audio-video and posted on the internet. This may well be the best and most fair tool for evaluating applicants. In fact  I think it is. However  the assurance from the showcase committee that applicants don&rsquo;t need to provide professional level production values fails to realize that a great deal of expertise is needed to provide amateur level videos of even solo performers with audiences  and many artists are simply not suited for such tasks.</p>  <p>These artists without requisite technical skills tend not to show up  which gives the impression that those that do show up represent all artists and all artists therefor have the necessary technical know-how. Some of these artists that don't show up are also first class entertainers.</p>  <p>Those that are suited  having already shouldered the tasks of self-management and self-booking  will have even less time to practice  rehearse and develop artistically. Has this already resulted in Better Entertainment Value and Lesser Artistic Content? I think so.</p>  <p>A service organization should not accept that such burdens be placed on any of its members without also seeking  as a high priority  to assess their weight and  if possible  to lessen them.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Please sign the petition. &mdash;David Nigel Lloyd</p>,Cindy Bottomley, Secretary of FAR-West,custom,FAR-West's entertainers-only showcasing requirement is harmful  costly and off-mission. Respectfully  I ask you: please rethink and change this requirement before it becomes "accepted wisdom" if not policy.

This practice has already been the subject of much argument and disgruntlement. More than once  supporters of the practice have asserted that entertainment is merely a loaded word that means the same as engagement  a non-loaded word. I disagree. A musician engages with their art and with their presence as an artist. A musician can also engage with costumes  stage patter  laser shows etc. That kind of engagement is called entertainment. The one does not exclude the other but they are not the same thing.

The requirement is harmful because the Official Showcase as an entertainment event makes the statement that all roads lead to this stage; those that dont are dead ends. It is harmful to many musicians and organizations for whom entertainment has no relevancy and for whom  in part  Folk Alliance was founded. The opportunity and validation the showcase offers is denied them if they choose not to wrap their artistry in sufficient entertainment value.  

The Official Showcase as entertainment event blinds us to our own rich heritage. It precludes musical traditions that predate the modern cultural invention of entertainment by centuries. It also precludes countless musicians and singers whose purpose was and is social outrage and change and for whom the label entertainer would be an insult. Furthermore  it precludes folk music with ritual purposes (hymns) or with social purposes (dance tunes). These are just examples of kinds of folk music for which the word 'entertainment' is meaningless. To the extent that practitioners of these types of music are still members  they now find themselves marginalized within the very organization that was founded to support them. Also  the singer/songwriter whose legitimate goal is to entertain is by this practice deprived of the nutrients in which his or her art is rooted.

Participation in the Official Showcase as entertainment event is costly in time and money to applicants and non-applicants both. The music business has for many years held the position that any successful artist must appropriate expertise in artist management and agenting  in computer technology  social media  audio and audio-visual technologies  all at the expense of their own artistry. We in the folk community look to organizations like FAR-West for support and solidarity in combatting such oppressive expectations. Instead  FAR-West has merely capitulated without question. Please question these expectations and their effect on your constituents.

Our MISSION  according to FAR-West  is to strengthen the ecology for folk music and build stronger artists  presenters and audiences. FAR-West's entertainers-only showcasing requirement decimates the ecology and builds stronger seeming entertainers while conditioning presenters and audiences to be happy with less and less of the essential artistry that makes folk music folk music.

Please abandon these deleterious practices and resume the task of fulfilling the mission upon which FAR-West was granted its chapter status from Folk Alliance International. FAR-West is too important; the effects of much good work you and volunteers like Peggy Glenn have already accomplished should not be diminished or nullified by this egregious error in understanding.  ,21,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/6/sk/cg/xVsKcgYDFQpACqs-556x313-cropped.jpg,Economic Justice,100,2013-09-05T19:23:20Z,2014-09-05T23:59:59Z,David Nigel Lloyd,http://api.change.org/u/61378535,None,None
