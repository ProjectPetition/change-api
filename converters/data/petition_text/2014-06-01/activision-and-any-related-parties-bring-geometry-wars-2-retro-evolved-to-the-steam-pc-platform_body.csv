1308219,Activision and any related parties: Bring Geometry Wars 2 retro Evolved to the STEAM / PC Platform!,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/activision-and-any-related-parties-bring-geometry-wars-2-retro-evolved-to-the-steam-pc-platform,<p>I am a huge fan of Geometry Wars 2 - Retro Evolved  and Many other owners of the Xbox 360 version no longer use this system  or they are forced to keep this system running only to play this masterpiece of a game  OR they simply don't have the system anymore and are denied being able to enjoy it at all. The original version (geometry wars) IS available on STEAM currently and while it is enjoyed by many; it is significantly inferior game  lacking all of the fun additional modes the sequel offers.</p>  <p>In addition to this  Geometry Wars (the original) on Steam  is a very basic (read: poor) port  lacking leader-boards. We fans of the sequel would want the sequel brought into the STEAM/PC platform with the FULL treatment...including leader-boards  co-op/competitive play  etc...</p>  <p>ALSO something new requested would be incredible: ONLINE Multi-player would be a huge bonus for the loyal fans of this game!</p>  <p>As per the Wikipedia page for Geometry Wars 2 Retro Evolved:</p>  <p>---------- <br />"Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 received high marks from critics  who praised its multiple game modes while also collectively bemoaning the lack of online multiplayer. GameDaily raved in its perfect 10/10 review that the sequel "beats its predecessor in every way" and proclaimed it the best title on Xbox Live Arcade.[15] Eurogamer praised  "The omission of online play aside  Geometry Wars 2 is everything you hoped it would be" in its 9 of 10 review.[9] IGN  in its 8.3 of 10 review  called it "a solid sequel."[11] Videogamer raved in its 9 for 10 review  "If you love Geometry Wars you'll love this. If you've never played Geometry Wars before then now is a perfect time to do so."[16] GameSpot enthusiastically stated in its 9.0 of 10 review that the game "takes adrenaline-soaked  addictive shooters to a level of unprecedented awesomeness." <br />----------</p>  <p>Please bring this game to STEAM  there is currently a petition thread in the STEAM forums for the original Geometry Wars for this  and there is over 220 posts (at the time of this petition starting) of fans of GW2 eagerly posting that they would love to buy this game if it should come to pass!</p>  <p>In conclusion and to summarize  we request in order of priority:</p>  <p>1. Geometry Wars 2 Retro Evolved be released on Steam/PC <br />2. That it contain full leader-board support <br />3. That it support LOCAL multi-player co-op/competitive as per the Xbox 360 version <br />4. That it support ONLINE multi-player co-op/competitive support (New!)</p>,Activision,custom,Please Bring Geometry Wars 2 to the STEAM / PC Platform!
