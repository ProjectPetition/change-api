1376671,Improve access to medical & pension benefits for CAF members and veterans living with PTSD!,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/improve-access-to-medical-pension-benefits-for-caf-members-and-veterans-living-with-ptsd,<p>On 7 July 2011  after almost a decade in Afghanistan  Canada officially terminated combat military operations there  though about a thousand soldiers will continue to provide training support for Afghan security forces there until 2014.&nbsp; Almost 30 000 Canadian service personnel were deployed to Afghanistan  outstripping Canadian participation in Korea and making Afghanistan our largest military operation since WW II.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>The extended cost of the Afghanistan mission continues to show itself directly in the tragic experiences of some soldiers  who sometimes paid with their mental health for their service; and indirectly in the equally devastating experience of family and friends left to pick up the pieces in a system which  if not broken  is certainly badly wounded.</p>  <p>Accurate figures on suicide by serving members of the Canadian military are difficult to come by.&nbsp; DND has adjusted its own figures for 2011  for instance  and the number varies from DND&rsquo;s first report of 19  to an adjusted report of 22  to a high of 35 from a non-DND source. Listed below are figures which represent as accurate a tally as I&rsquo;ve been able to find.&nbsp; Numbers here do not include reservists or veterans.</p>  <p>&nbsp;2007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36 suicides&nbsp; (CBC reports that 36 suicides in 2007 were listed as &ldquo;sudden deaths &rdquo; with 12 clearly marked suicide and 21 cases listed as "investigated." National Defence officials did not dispute that the document is a suicide list  but did not respond to requests from CBC to explain the new categories.)</p>  <p>&nbsp;2008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 suicides</p>  <p>&nbsp;2009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 suicides</p>  <p>&nbsp;2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 suicides</p>  <p>&nbsp;2011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22 suicides</p>  <p>&nbsp;2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 suicides</p>  <p>&nbsp;Figures for 2013 have not yet been released  although a recent spate of suicides and suicide attempts have caught the eye of Canadians across the country. &nbsp;Three Canadian soldiers took their own lives in November 2013 &mdash; all of them veterans of the war in Afghanistan. &nbsp;Warrant Officer Michael McNeil  Master Cpl. William Elliott  and Master Bombardier Travis Halmrast have all got a place on 2013 statistical report of suicides.</p>  <p>&nbsp;Master Cpl. Kristian Wolowidnyk  a husband and father  was denied the opportunity to qualify for another military trade and advised that his psychological injuries  including anxiety and serious depression  did not qualify him to remain in the military as part of a prolonged release process for injured soldiers.&nbsp; He spent a week in the mental health wing of the civilian Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton before being released to his family &ndash; and to confront the reality of his military career coming to an abrupt end in February.</p>  <p>Like other Canadian Forces veterans  Wolowidnyk was told he does not meet the military&rsquo;s &ldquo;universality-of-service rule &rdquo; which requires all members to be fit enough to deploy at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; When he is released  he&rsquo;ll be roughly 18 months short of the 10-year mark  which would have qualified him for a fully indexed military pension.</p>  <p>James Bezan  Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Defence Rob Nicholson  said DND has &ldquo;compartmentalized&rdquo; $50 million a year just for dealing with mental health. &nbsp;Bezan says that &ldquo;Suicide rates within the Canadian Armed Forces [are] well below the Canadian national average;&rdquo; however  it&rsquo;s unclear whether he refers only to full-time active duty soldiers or includes reserve forces in this estimation; the estimate is unlikely to include members who&rsquo;ve been released from the Canadian Forces and have subsequently killed themselves.&nbsp; And while $50-million sounds like a lot of money  if you factor in the salaries of the 400 uniformed and civilian service providers estimated to be providing mental health services  either as direct professional support or administrative support  at least 50% of that budget would be salary dollars.&nbsp; Bezan has not suggested that the $50-million is in addition to salary and providing direct assistance to soldiers.</p>  <p>PTSD expert Dr. Greg Passey suggests that this week&rsquo;s suicides won&rsquo;t be the last  noting that 50% of soldiers with mental health problems will contemplate suicide and 19 per cent will actually attempt it. Pierre Daigle  Canadian Forces ombudsman  has noted that National Defence has long faced a 15-20% shortage of mental health professionals.</p>  <p>Many soldiers on active duty suffer silently  fearing what may happen to them if they seek help. Veterans&rsquo; advocates say that recent suicides may only hint at the magnitude of the problem. For every death by suicide  they warn  as many as 12 others may have sought the same fate.&nbsp; It is also worth noting that the proportion of veterans who suffer from PTSD is higher than for serving members. The highest proportion - 42.5% - is found among veterans receiving services from Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) since the coming into force of its New Veterans Charter on 1 April 2006.</p>  <p>The Canadian Forces still has not completed inquiries into 50 suicides among military members  some from as far back as five years ago. The military has boards of inquiries under way into the 50 deaths  including four from 2008 and seven from 2009.&nbsp; Seven boards are still underway for suicides in 2010 and 20 for 2011.</p>  <p><strong>Studies say&hellip;. (excerpted from Parliamentary Report: Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and the Mental Health of Military Personnel and Veterans (<a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2011-97-e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2011-97-e.htm</a>)</strong></p>  <p>The potential psychological after-effects of involvement in military operations are usually described by the medical term &ldquo;post-traumatic stress disorder&rdquo; (PTSD)  or the military and police term &ldquo;operational stress injury.&rdquo; These after-effects are more difficult to anticipate than physical injuries because they are less visible  reluctantly reported by those who suffer from them  and because the symptoms may only appear years after the traumatic event. Our understanding of the condition is therefore imperfect  and there are no certainties  except for the distress of those affected</p>  <p>The proportion of serving members suffering from PTSD tends initially to be close to that of the general population  but it becomes significantly higher as exposure to combat or atrocities increases.</p>  <p>When a soldier is injured in service and the injury  whether physical or mental  leads to permanent disability  VAC pays an award in one or more instalments  the amount of which varies with the severity of the disability. The maximum amount for a 100% disability is $285 000  but approximately 15% of disabled soldiers or veterans are considered to have a disability of less than 5% ($14 250). The award may be paid to a member who is still in service or to a veteran. In most cases  the disability does not prevent the person from continuing a career within the CF.</p>  <p>If the disability is serious  however  the person must be released from the CF on medical grounds. A decision concerning the necessity of a release is made only once the injury can be described as having &ldquo;stabilized.&rdquo; As long as the person is a member of the military  the CF is responsible for health care and rehabilitation. Once the decision has been made to release the member for medical reasons  two or three years usually go by before the person is permanently no longer a member of the CF. Once this time period has elapsed  and not before  VAC may begin to provide rehabilitation programs and medical services.</p>  <p>Approximately 30% of soldiers deployed in a combat zone will suffer symptoms of operational stress injury during their lifetime  and approximately 10% will suffer from a severe form of PTSD. Repeated exposure to combat operations will cause this percentage to increase.</p>  <p>Given that  with the end of combat operations in Afghanistan  a total of between 25 000 and 35 000 soldiers will be released from the CF over the next five years  at least 2 750 of them can be expected to suffer from a severe form of PTSD and at least 6 500 will suffer from a mental health problem diagnosed by a health professional.</p>  <p><strong>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</strong>&nbsp; Nobody who joins the Canadian Military signs up for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.&nbsp; The parents  siblings  spouses  and children of active-duty members and veterans definitely didn&rsquo;t sign up for this.&nbsp; If you believe that the Canadian Government must provide more tangible support to members and veterans who seek or who are referred to mental health services  then SAY SO.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If you think it&rsquo;s outrageous that with its &ldquo;400 service providers &rdquo; the Canadian Forces still has 50 investigations of suicides outstanding  some dating back to 2007/2008  then SAY SO.</p>  <p>If you think that soldiers in Afghanistan who came home to develop PTSD deserve better than being pushed out on an unwanted medical release with scant service and inadequate pension benefits  then SAY SO.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>WHO CAN YOU TELL?</strong>&nbsp; You can comment on this petition  which will be forwarded to the Minister of National Defence  Rob Nicholson.&nbsp; You can tell the Minister yourself that you are concerned (and if you&rsquo;ve signed this petition  I&rsquo;d suggest that you SHOULD tell the Minister) &ndash; his email is <a href="mailto:dnd_mdn@forces.gc.ca" rel="nofollow">dnd_mdn@forces.gc.ca</a>.</p>  <p>You can tell your own MP  and if you&rsquo;re not sure who that is  you can find out right here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/HouseofCommons/MemberByPostalCode.aspx?Menu=HOC" rel="nofollow">http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/HouseofCommons/MemberByPostalCode.aspx?Menu=HOC</a></p>  <p>&nbsp;Consider emailing Peter Stoffer  long an advocate of veterans&rsquo; rights  at <a href="mailto:peter.stoffer@parl.gc.ca" rel="nofollow">peter.stoffer@parl.gc.ca</a>.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE YOU BELIEVE MAY BE AT RISK?&nbsp; <br /></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Canadian Forces Member Assistance Program has a confidential 24/7 toll-free telephone advisory and referral service for all military personnel and their families.
