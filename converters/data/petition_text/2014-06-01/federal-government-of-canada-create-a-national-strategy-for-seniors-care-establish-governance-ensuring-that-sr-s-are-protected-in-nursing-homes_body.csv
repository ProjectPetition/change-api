1369578,Federal Government of Canada: Create a National Strategy for Seniors Care - Establish Governance ensuring that Sr's are protected in nursing homes,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/federal-government-of-canada-create-a-national-strategy-for-seniors-care-establish-governance-ensuring-that-sr-s-are-protected-in-nursing-homes,<p>My name is Michael Alexander I am the son of Frank Alexander who was featured in the W5 episode called deadly care. <a href="http://www.ctvnews.c%20i%20am%20the%20son%20of%20frank%20alexander%20who%20a/video?clipId=1012634" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctvnews.c%20i%20am%20the%20son%20of%20frank%20alexander%20who%20a/video?clipId=1012634</a></p>  <p>My Father was the center piece of the story as he was a victim of nursing home violence which cost him his life. As a family we participated in the W5 show  pressured the government successfully to have an Inquest and we have hired a lawyer to ensure that all parties involved in the mismanagement of our Dad&rsquo;s situation be held accountable in a court of law. The sad reality  is that I have seen first-hand how bad this situation is and it terrifies me.</p>  <p>W5 did an amazing story and nailed the issue hard. 63 senior citizens have been killed in nursing homes over the last 12 years and the spike in violence is shooting skyward. People are living longer  and Alzheimer and Dementia is on the rise. Nursing homes are ill equipped to protect other residents and in many cases themselves. The man who killed my father attacked staff members on 9 other occasions  and was allowed to roam freely within the nursing home.</p>  <p>Canada needs an over arching governing body dedicated to ensuring that the elderly are protected! That nursing home standards are consistant and that best practices and learned lessons are shared. 38 different Health Authorities across Canada and no governing body or national strategy to protect the elderly in Nursing homes.</p>  <p>If you want the Federal Government to establish a National Strategy for Sr Care please sign this petition.</p>  <p>Here is some reference information for you  in case you are not aware of the situation. <a href="http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/canada/archives/2013/01/20130103-143220.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/canada/archives/2013/01/20130103-143220.html</a> <a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/01/06/national-post-editorial-board-our-alzheimers-crisis-in-tragic-microcosm/" rel="nofollow">http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/01/06/national-post-editorial-board-our-alzheimers-crisis-in-tragic-microcosm/</a> <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/w5/w5-investigation-reveals-national-crisis-homicide-in-care-homes-1.1473935" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctvnews.ca/w5/w5-investigation-reveals-national-crisis-homicide-in-care-homes-1.1473935</a></p>,[],[],Create a National Strategy for Seniors Care - Establish Governance ensuring that Sr's are protected in nursing homes
