1301182,Wii U owners want DLC for Call of Duty: Ghost: Announce DLC plans for COD: Ghost on Wii U.,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/wii-u-owners-want-dlc-for-call-of-duty-ghost-announce-dlc-plans-for-cod-ghost-on-wii-u,<p>Wii U owners are gamers just like other gamers on PC  PS3  360  etc. Why should Wii U owners get shafted? We pay money to play games just like everyone else  if DLC does come to Wii U just like every other platform  guess what  more people will get the Wii U version. If no DLC ever comes to the Wii U  don't complain to us Wii U owners for not buying the game because we didn't want to buy a gimped version of a game.</p>,[],[],Announce DLC plans for COD: Ghost on Wii U.
