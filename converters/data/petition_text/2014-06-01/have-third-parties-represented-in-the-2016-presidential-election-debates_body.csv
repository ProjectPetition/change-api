813276,Have third parties represented in the 2016 Presidential election debates.,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/have-third-parties-represented-in-the-2016-presidential-election-debates,<p>Millions of voters get their information about the presidential candidates by watching the debates.</p>  <p>As it stands right now the Commission on Presidential Debates was established by Democratic and Republican parties - they have kept third parties out while the people of this country want them in. Please sign the petition and have your voice heard.</p>  <p>Both Democrats and Republicans intentionally ignore the deep problems and corruption facing our government out of deference to the financial elites that keep them in power. <strong>Citizens United</strong> being passed with both parties at the helm was a huge red flag that our democracy is being <strong>eroded by both parties</strong>.</p>  <p>Because our electoral system is created to favor a two party system  both parties can remain silent as the concerns of<strong> average Americans continue to be ignored</strong> and worsen with time. In the last elections you heard nothing about the deepening poverty issue in America...yet <strong>1 in 6 Americans are food insecure</strong>. And <strong>1 in 3 people</strong> in this country <strong>are in poverty.</strong></p>  <p>Historically  &nbsp;<strong>third-party candidates have forced those who can win to address issues of critical importance to the electorate when they would rather avoid them.</strong>&nbsp;It's time for the presidential candidates to start addressing the concerns of the American people directly or make space for those with the courage to do so.</p>  <p>Please tell the Commission on Presidential Debates and the Citizens Debate Commission either<strong> allow third party candidates in all presidential debates</strong> or no longer exist as a platform in elections. The people of this country will create a new and more legitimate model for debates...<strong>choice is the only answer</strong>. And we leave it up to the way it is today -we will never get better choices with better solutions for this country. Please sign the petition and help create a new model for <strong>debates that serve the people.</strong></p>,The United States, The Commission on Presidential Debates 2016,custom,As it stands right now the Commission on Presidential Debates was established by Democratic and Republican parties - you have kept third parties out while the people of this country want them in. 

Its time we have a new conversation in this country and that means new ideas and visions in politics. Maybe its time the people create a new platform for Presidential debates that represent the voice of the people in this country - not the parties.,524,//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/5/uf/py/zSUfPyRVVUbOBgH-556x313-cropped.jpg,Women's Rights,150000,2012-10-21T09:50:29Z,2016-10-03T23:59:59Z,Debo Grim,http://api.change.org/u/debo,None,None
