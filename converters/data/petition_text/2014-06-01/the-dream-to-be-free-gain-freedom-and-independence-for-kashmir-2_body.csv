477374,The Dream to be Free: Gain Freedom and Independence for Kashmir,open,http://api.change.org/petitions/the-dream-to-be-free-gain-freedom-and-independence-for-kashmir-2,<p>The people of Azad Kashmir  Jammu and Kashmir  Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract need to gain an identity of their own  a place to call home  and most importantly to gain the Freedom from genocides and other attacks of terror that they receive. The people of Kashmir deserve a better and SAFE life style not only for themselves  but to better the future that they hold. The Conflict with Kashmir has been one of the oldest unresolved disputes in the world. The people of Kashmir deserve an identity  and deserve to cherish the values  and cultural beliefs that are among the Kashmiri people  that are slowly being lost. The Kashmiri people have suffered for a long time  and have been innocently killed for being in between the wars India  Pakistan and China have had. We the people of Kashmir are not ordinary people. We too have a voice that can be heard from miles  but it just seems no one&rsquo;s brave enough to step in and help us. No one can HELP the Kashmiris gain a good Education  good Healthcare  good Jobs  good Everything etc...BUT if everybody joins hands in this cause they will Help THE KASHMIRI People Gain Freedom and Be able to have Everything and more. We need a safe place for our children  adults  and elders to grow. We need our education that most Kashmiris don&rsquo;t even receive because there are no schools in their area or teachers to be found  and Healthcare let&rsquo;s not even go down that road. By Helping Spread Awareness about the issues on Our occupied home Kashmir we all can shed a small spark  which in turn could become a light for all of us. Please put fourth your opinions and why We deserve freedom  and the benefits we as Kashmiris will have. Every Signature is one step further to freedom. Everyone deserves to have a voice  and it is everyone&rsquo;s right to have Freedom and we want the right that&rsquo;s been taken from us many years ago back. Remember Every Voice(signature) counts.</p>,The Dream to be Free,custom,I just signed the following petition addressed to: The Dream to be Free.

Gain Freedom and Independence for Kashmir

Hi 
On July 7  2012 I started a petition for the freedom of Kashmir. I believe in todays society we should be able to gain freedom  and live a healthy independent life  without clinching our life with fear.
With the wars  genocides  and other terror attacks the people of Kashmir have received  I think its about time this issue be resolved. The dispute over Kashmir has been one of the longest and oldest unresolved disputes in the world. I believe the killing of innocent Kashmiri people should be banished  along with the unstable governing systems that have been emplaced. I believe every person in Kashmir deserves the necessities that our world has to offer. The best opportunities await the people of Kashmir  but just when will it be their time. When will the Kashmiri people receive the education  healthcare  a safe environment to live in  a place to work and prosper  clean water  and other needs that are required to be a free bird out of a closed cage? When will it be the time for the children that are suffering to become successful  for they are the ones who hold the future of tomorrow?  
With a vast amount of problems Kashmiris face on a day to day basis  comparing our problems  are not even close to comparison. With their culture  language  traditions  and lands being destroyed  I only hope I could shine a spark of light to help their problems with the petition I have created  thanks to one of my teachers. I hope you could help me spread awareness to this issue  and help gain the freedom of Kashmir  and help me spread my voice to millions of others that I cannot reach. Please keep in mind that I also have written petitions as well.  if we all just change our thoughts we can all change the world together.

Sincerely 
Attia(Tia) Khan
