Get rid of kill shelters","open","http://api.change.org/petitions/state-of-new-york-get-rid-of-kill-shelters","I really think it's in humane to kill perfectly healthy dogs. I think that there's should be no such thing as killing dogs or any animal for that matter. But dogs are eauthanized every day. It shouldn't be.
