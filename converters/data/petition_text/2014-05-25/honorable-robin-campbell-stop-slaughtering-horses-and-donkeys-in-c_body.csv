1419655,"Honorable Robin Campbell Stop slaughtering horses and donkeys in Canada!","open","http://api.change.org/petitions/honorable-robin-campbell-stop-slaughtering-horses-and-donkeys-in-canada","<p>This is important to all Canadians who value the lives of animal companions. We have the right to demand fair treatment of these intelligent animals and are calling all government agencies&nbsp;to put an end to this cruel practice&nbsp;once and for all! &nbsp;The majority of the public wants the government to stop allowing these facilities to process horse meat.&nbsp; It's time we must take a stand for the horses&nbsp;and donkeys and no longer tollerate this unfair treatment of these intelligent animals!</p>\r\n<p><span><span>The people of Canada are compassionate and caring people.<span>&nbsp; </span>We will not stop voicing our concern for the horses and donkeys until they are treated with the utmost respect that they deserve.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this day and age it is appalling and very sad to think that right here at home in Canada we are being known around the world for our horse killing practices. This is unacceptable. <span>I ask that you please take the necessary action today and stand up for the horses and donkeys who&rsquo;s desperate cries cannot be heard. </span></span></span></p>","Minister of Environment Canada","MLA Edmonton- McClung","Minister of Environment and Sustainable Resource Development",,,"Stop slaughtering horses and donkeys in Canada !!!\r\n",1560,"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/7/vp/ru/zKVPrUlnwsJheDf-556x313-cropped.jpg","Animals",2500,2014-01-24T16,2015-01-24T23,Joy,Komarnicki,"""http://api.change.org/u/34969780""",null,null
